/* shell_platform()
 *
 * The shell should return a null-terminated string here that identifies the
 * app's version number, and the platform it is built for. So, something like
 * "2.5.3 Windows". N.B. It is not necessary to identify the version of the OS
 * we're running on; what matters is the version of the app itself, and
 * "Windows" conveys that information, while "Windows 2000 sp4" or "Windows 10"
 * would add nothing useful.
 * The returned string will not be freed by the caller, so it can be passed in
 * a static buffer, or it may even be a constant.
 */

/* shell_blitter()
 *
 * Callback invoked by the emulator core to cause the display, or some portion
 * of it, to be repainted.
 *
 * 'bits' is a pointer to a 1 bpp (monochrome) bitmap. The bits within a byte
 * are laid out with left corresponding to least significant, right
 * corresponding to most significant; this corresponds to the convention for
 * X11 images, but it is the reverse of the convention for MacOS and Windows.
 * The bytes are laid out sequentially, that is, bits[0] is at the top
 * left corner, bits[1] is to the right of bits[0], bits[2] is to the right of
 * bits[1], and so on; this corresponds to X11, MacOS, and Windows usage.
 * 'bytesperline' is the number of bytes per line of the bitmap; this means
 * that the bits just below bits[0] are at bits[bytesperline].
 * 'x', 'y', 'width', and 'height' define the part of the bitmap that needs to
 * be repainted. 'x' and 'y' are 0-based coordinates, with (0, 0) being the top
 * left corner of the bitmap, and x coordinates increasing to the right, and y
 * coordinates increasing downwards. 'width' and 'height' are the width and
 * height of the area to be repainted.

 * in this call! If there are pending events, it should return 1; the currently
 * active invocation of core_keydown() or core_keyup() will then return

 *
 * The units used here match those on the iPhone; implementations on other
 * platforms should transform their units to match iPhone conventions. This
 * probably won't be an issue in practice, since the iPhone's units match
 * established international standards, the one exception being acceleration,

 * m/s^2. TODO: what is the exact conversion factor used by the iPhone?

 * positive; lat_lon_acc, elev, and elev_acc are in meters. TODO: what is
 * elev relative to?
 * shell_get_heading: mag_heading and true_heading are in decimal degrees,
 * along the y axis (using the same coordinate system as described above),
 * with 0 being N, 90 being E, etc., acc is in decimal degrees, and x, y, and z
 * are magnetic deviation (again using the same coordinate system as above),
 * in microteslas, but normalized to the range -128..128. TODO: What's this
 * "normalization"? I hope they mean "clipped", because otherwise you wouldn't
 * have a unit, yet they claim the unit is microteslas.
