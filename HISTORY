2019-08-31: release 2.5.2

* In the States window, renamed Reload to Revert, and added a confirmation
  dialog, since that is a potentially destructive action.
* When programs were imported from raw files, empty progams were sometimes
  being created unnecessarily. Harmless but slightly annoying. Fixed.
* Android and iOS versions: Added "share" option for Print-Out view.
* Android and iOS versions: Added "share" option for programs in raw format.
* Android and iOS versions: Now import raw files directly from email
  attachments and web links.

2019-08-28: release 2.5.1

* Fixed bug in 2.5 that caused string elements in real matrices (including the
  numbered registers) to be written incorrectly in the state file, leading to
  memory corruption and crashes when the state file was read back in.
* iPhone version: Now makes sure that the current state shows up in the list in
  the States view, even if it is opened right after a fresh install or right
  after upgrading from a version before 2.5.

2019-08-25: release 2.5

* Added state file manager, for loading, saving, and switching between,
  calculator states. The state files are in a platform-neutral format, so they
  can be exchanged between Free42 instances running on different devices.
* Fixed crash in RTN when a local variable was hiding the indexed matrix.

2019-07-12: release 2.4.2

* Windows version: The new Ctrl-A, Ctrl-I, and Ctrl-T shortcuts (Paper Advance,
  Copy Print-Out as Image, and Copy Print-Out as Text) didn't work, because I
  hadn't updated the corresponding accelerator resources. Fixed.
* Windows and Linux versions: All Ctrl-<Key> shortcuts now work even when the
  Print-Out window is on top.
* Android, iPhone, and Mac versions: When loading a skin in the skin browser,
  they now force an un-cached load, so skin fixes can actually be loaded by
  users without delay, and without having to resort to side-loading.
* Android and iPhone versions: Changed default landscape skin, from
  desktop/42ct to android/SGS-L. The old skin had keys below the display that
  didn't line up with the menus; you really have to have Σ+ 1/x √x LOG LN XEQ
  below the display for a consistent user interface.
* iPhone version: Changed Standard-X skin, from Ehrling42sl.X to Matt42X. The
  old skin was rather blurry; the new skin has nice and crisp text for all key
  labels.

2019-07-03: release 2.4.1

* Fixed several bugs in BWRAP mode.

2019-07-01: release 2.4

* Implemented configurable word size for BASE functions (up to 64 bits, or 52
  in Free42 Binary), unsigned mode, and wrap mode. The new settings are all in
  a new row in the MODES menu.
* Android, iPhone, and Mac versions: Added some feedback in the skin loading
  window: the "Load" button changes to "..." while a page load is in progress;
  "Load" is enabled only when a GIF or layout file is being displayed, i.e.
  something that could actually be a skin, and therefore loadable; and finally,
  when Load is pressed to load a skin, an alert box is now shown to report
  success or failure.

2019-06-25: release 2.3.1a (Android only)

* Adding -mfpu=vfp to compilation flags when building the Intel library for
  armv7. Apparently, with NDK r19c, Neon is enabled by default, but Neon is not
  supported on all armv7 Android devices, so this setting is causing 2.3.1 to
  crash on certain phones. (2.2.1b and earlier were built with an earlier NDK,
  which did not have this problem.)

2019-06-25: release 2.3.1

* Android version: Implemented the 2.3 features, with the exception of Copy
  Print-Out as Image. (Apparently Android doesn't support images on the
  clipboard.)
* Mac version: Copy Print-Out as Image didn't handle wrap-around in the image
  buffer correctly. Fixed.
* Windows and Linux version: Implemented Paper Advance, Copy Print-Out as Text,
  and Copy Print-Out as Image.
* iPhone version: Fixed the top-of-screen menu trigger so that it no longer
  sabotages keys that are also in that area, as in the HP_Mega_42 and SGS-L
  skins. This is the same fix I made for Android in release 1.5.8d. I didn't
  think to fix this for iPhone at the time, probably because the iPhone version
  didn't support landscape mode then.

2019-06-15: release 2.3.0a (iPhone only)

* Added the 2.3 features.
  This should have been called version 2.3 as well, but a mistake with the
  release build forced me to use the next higher version number instead.

2019-06-12: release 2.3 (Mac only)

* Added Load Skins feature, for downloading and installing skins from the
  Internet.
* Added Delete Skins feature.
* Added Paper Advance for Print-Out window.
* Added Copy Print-Out as Text and Copy Print-Out as Image.

2019-05-29: release 2.2.1d (source code only)

* Migrated the Android project from Eclipse with ADT to Android Studio.
  Also building the native code for x86 and x86_64 now. Not sure if I should
  release that, but it is convenient for testing in the Android Emulator, now
  that Google no longer releases ARM system images for the emulator.
  The minimum Android API level requirement went from 8 to 14 (2.2 to 4.0), but
  that seems like an acceptable price to pay.

2019-05-24: release 2.2.1c (iPhone only)

* Fixed crash in Paste when clipboard contained no text.

2019-05-20: release 2.2.1b (Android only)

* Made the app explicitly single-instance (by adding
  launchMode="singleInstance" to Free42Activity in the app manifest).
  This should eliminate the remaining null-pointer crashes in the native code,
  and also prevent State File Corrupt scenarios.

2019-05-19: release 2.2.1a (Android only)

* Added 64-bit native code.

2019-05-11: release 2.2.1

* Added side margins to print-out window.
* PRLCD is now supported in "Print to Text," using Unicode 2x2 block elements.
* Flag 64 is now set or cleared to indicate the Shift state during the most
  recent key press. This can be used by MENU handlers to implement different
  behaviors for unshifted and shifted menu keys.
* Windows version: Changed sounds from using the Beep() function to playing
  wav sounds using the PlaySound() function, matching the way sounds are played
  in the Android, iPhone, and Mac versions.
* MacDashboard version: Didn't recognize comma as decimal key. Fixed.

2019-04-07: release 2.2

* Implemented YMD mode for date functions, using YYYY.MMDD as the numeric
  format and YYYY-MM-DD as the display format. Programs can check whether this
  mode is active by testing flag 67. If flag 67 is clear, the mode is indicated
  by flag 31 (clear = MDY, set = DMY), as before.
* Local variables. You create them with the new LSTO function, and they
  disappear automatically when the current subroutine ends, by executing RTN or
  END. If a local variable is created with a name that matches an already-
  existing variable, the older variable is hidden until the local variable goes
  away.
* Dynamically growing RTN stack. It is not unlimited; in order to prevent
  infinite recursion from eating up all memory, it maxes out at 1024 levels.
  The new stack behaves a bit different than the old version (and the real
  HP-42S): when an XEQ happens while the stack is full, the old version would
  silently discard the oldest RTN, while with the new version, this returns a
  "RTN Stack Full" error.
* Added support for direct command mapping in skins. This is specified by
  creating Macro: lines where the macro is not a sequence of keystrokes, but a
  command name enclosed in double quotes, e.g., Macro: 40 "SST→"
* Windows, Mac, and Linux versions: In skin layout files, they now look for
  keymap entries tagged as "WinKey:", "MacKey:", or "GtkKey:", respectively.
  This allows embedding keymaps for multiple platforms in one layout file.
  This does mean that old-style keymap entries, with no identifying tags, are
  no longer recognized. Out of all the skins in my collection, the only
  affected skins are desktop/42ck and desktop/42ct. If you use these skins,
  you'll want to download the updated layout files.

2019-03-27: release 2.1.1 (Android only)

* The "Maintain skin aspect ratio" setting didn't stick when the app was exited
  and restarted. Fixed.

2019-03-26: release 2.1

* New functions: SST↑ (Step Out) and SST→ (Step Over). Step Out runs the
  program until the end of the current subroutine; Step Over executes one step,
  but if that step is an XEQ, SOLVE, or INTEG, it runs until the subroutine
  returns, or SOLVE or INTEG are done. When Step Out is performed in a function
  called by SOLVE or INTEG, the program runs until SOLVE or INTEG are done.
* Added SST↓ (Step Into), which is just an alias for SST. This allows creating
  a row in the CUSTOM menu with SST↓, SST→, and SST↑, like in typical high-
  level language debuggers.
* Android and iPhone versions: Improved "Maintain skin aspect ratio" option: it
  now chooses the largest scale where the skin still fits on the screen in its
  entirety, and centers the skin within the available space.
* iPhone version: The "Maintain skin aspect ratio" and "Print to text" options
  in the Preferences were switched. Fixed.
* iPhone version: Fixed handling of announcements in the status bar (audio
  recording, active call, active GPS).
* iPhone version: Turned optimization back on. It looks like the optimizer bug
  (see release notes for 2.0.21a) has been fixed.

2019-03-18: release 2.0.24h (Android only)

* The screen update logic in the previous version was incorrect and caused the
  app to appear unresponsive on many devices. Fixed.

2019-03-17: release 2.0.24g (Android, iPhone, and Mac)

* Android, iPhone, and Mac versions: Enabled non-integral display scaling.
* Android and iPhone versions: Added setting in Preferences to choose whether
  to stretch skins to fill the screen, or to stretch them only to fill the
  available width, while maintaining their original aspect ratio.
* iPhone version: Implemented support for landscape orientation.
* iPhone version: Fixed alignment of "Done" buttons.

2019-03-08: release 2.0.24f (iPhone only)

* Added Haptic Feedback setting in Preferences.

2019-03-03: release 2.0.24e (Android only)

* Fixed crash when calling ON or OFF from a program.
* Fixed a bug that could leave a corrupted state file under certain
  circumstances.

2019-02-28: release 2.0.24d (Android only)

* Fixed crashes while printing.

2019-02-26: release 2.0.24c (Android and iPhone)

* Android version: Removed all restrictions on file selection dialogs, and
  instead added a "Home" button, so you can always navigate back to
  /sdcard/Android/data/com.thomasokken.free42 if you get stuck somewhere.
* iPhone version: Fixed the white bar that was showing up above the skin on
  iPads running iOS 12.

2019-02-25: release 2.0.24b (Android only)

* Made file selection dialogs full-screen.
* Fixed file selection behavior for Import Programs and Select Skin. It now
  starts in the writable storage directory, but does allow navigation out of
  it.

2019-02-25: release 2.0.24a (Android and Mac)

* Android version: Lifted file selector directory restriction for Import
  Programs and skin selection, keeping it in place for Export Programs and
  selecting print-out files.
* Mac version: The previous release broke Import Programs. Fixed.

2019-02-24: release 2.0.24

* Made program pasting a bit more lenient: tabs are now treated as spaces, and
  the following command names are now recognized: x, RCL*, RCLx, RCL/, STOx,
  X#0?, X#Y?, X<>0?, and X<>Y? (in addition to all the alternate spellings that
  were recognized previously).
* iPhone version: Added Key Clicks setting in Preferences.
* Windows and Mac versions: Now refuse to export zero programs. (The other
  versions already did this.) Also tweaked the file selection dialogs a bit.
* Android version: When running on 4.4 (KitKat) or later, now creates the
  storage directory, /sdcard/Android/data/com.thomasokken.free42, as soon as it
  has access. The file selection dialogs are now restricted to this directory
  and its subdirectories.

2019-02-18: release 2.0.23c (iPhone only)

* The previous release calculated the skin scale incorrectly for certain skins,
  causing them to be displayed too small. Fixed.

2019-02-17: release 2.0.23b (iPhone only)

* Enabled non-integral scaling for skins, so skins can fill the width of the
  screen on iPhone X series (X, XR, XS, XS Max) even if they were designed for
  older models with 3:4 or 9:16 screen aspect ratios.

2019-02-11: release 2.0.23a (iPhone only)

* Replaced iPhone X skin with a more screen-filling one.

2019-02-09: release 2.0.23

* SOLVE now tries harder when secant extrapolation gets stuck due to the secant
  being excessively steep.
* 0^0 now returns Invalid Data, not 1, for all combinations of real and complex
  arguments. The rationale for returning 1 was mathematically questionable, and
  Invalid Data is what the real HP-42S returns.
* iPhone version: Added basic iPhone X support.

2019-01-26: release 2.0.22c (Android only)

* New Main Menu. This should be compatible with all Android versions, including
  Amazon Fire HD tablets and other devices that sabotaged the old menu after it
  started targeting Android 8.
* Added code to request storage and GPS access when needed.

2019-01-13: release 2.0.22b (Android only)

* Another fix for invisible overflow menu items.

2019-01-12: release 2.0.22a (Android only)

* Fixed invisible overflow menu items.

2019-01-12: release 2.0.22

* Made pasting real scalars a bit more lenient: it is now permitted for there
  to be trailing non-numeric characters after the number, so pasting a number
  with an attached unit, say 50mm, yields the number 50, not the string "50mm".
* INPUT should clear any message from the display before showing the prompt,
  but it didn't. Fixed.
* When ALPHA mode is active on top of VARMENU, ASTO and ARCL should show the
  regular variable menus, but they showed the VARMENU instead. Fixed.
* During command entry, SST and BST should be disabled, but the code that tried
  to do this also prevented some legitimate uses of up-arrow and down-arrow,
  such as switching menu rows during FIX IND __.
* While entering a numeric LBL, it should be possible to switch to ALPHA mode,
  using Shift-ENTER, to switch from, say, LBL 3_ to LBL "3_ , as an alternative
  method of entering ALPHA labels that start with a digit. The HP-42S allows
  this, but Free42 didn't. Fixed.
* Android and iPhone versions: OFF now turns off "continuous on" mode.

2018-11-24: release 2.0.21b (Windows only)

* Fixed Alt-Tab behavior.

2018-07-03: release 2.0.21a (iPhone only)

* Turned off all optimization for release builds; the latest iOS developer
  tools appear to have a buggy optimizer, and it is causing number display in
  OCT and HEX modes to misbehave -- they show numbers with unwanted leading
  zeroes, for a total number of digits that would be appropriate for BIN mode,
  so 1=>1, 2=>02, 3=>03, 4=>004, etc.

2018-06-24: release 2.0.21

* Fixed complex SQRT so it returns exact results when Re(x) = 0 and Im(x)/2 is
  a perfect square.
* VARMENU would step through rows of multi-line menus in the wrong order.
  (You needed a function with 13 or more MVARs to notice this.) Fixed.
* When printing to GIF, changing the filename did not cause the GIF numbering
  sequence to restart at 1. Fixed.
* When printing to GIF, the output file is now flushed and closed immediately
  if there is no more room for at least another 9 pixels after printing -- in
  other words, when no more printing to that file is possible anyway. It used
  to wait until the next print request, or app close, before flushing and
  closing in this situation.
  Also, the minimum height of a GIF output file is now 16 pixels, down from 32.

2018-03-12: release 2.0.20

* MATA, MATB, and MATX should exhibit the same stack lift behavior as EDIT and
  EDITN, but didn't. Fixed.

2018-03-10: release 2.0.19

* Another EDIT/EDITN fix: in the real HP-42S, EDIT and EDITN don't actually
  disable stack lift; they preserve the stack lift state, which you can observe
  if you do ENTER vs. a stack-lift-enabling operation (say, X<>Y) just before
  invoking them. This behavior is not really useful, but it needs to be
  emulated anyway, since not doing so risks breaking HP-42S programs.
  This does not affect GOTO Row/Column.

2018-03-09: release 2.0.18

* EDIT, EDITN, and GOTO Row/Column should disable stack lift, but they didn't.
  Fixed.

2018-03-02: release 2.0.17

* Inserting or deleting an END would not always clear cached local GTO or XEQ
  targets, potentially causing local GTO or XEQ commands to jump to the wrong
  locations. Fixed, and also added code to repair such damage in existing state
  files.

2018-02-22: release 2.0.16

* 0 SEED initialized the random seed incorrectly, wasting one digit of
  randomness. Fixed.
* When importing raw files, E and -E are now recognized as 1 and -1, for
  compatibility with HP-41 raw files with synthetic numbers.
* When importing raw files, synthetic instructions are now handled more like
  the real HP-42S handles them. Basically, any argument >= 100 that isn't a
  stack register and that isn't a local label is treated as numeric. Arguments
  112-116 are always stack registers, even when that makes no sense (flags, 
  SigmaREG, etc.); 102-111 and 123-127 are only considered as A-J and a-e in
  LBL, GTO, and XEQ.
  Note that nothing very interesting happens as a result of these changes. They
  won't make synthetic HP-41C code work in Free42 any more than it does in the
  HP-42S; the behavior is just more like the real 42S now.

2018-02-17: release 2.0.15

* POSA would not find the search string if its only occurrence was at the very
  end of the alpha register. Fixed.
* Android version: Tweaked handling of low-battery indicator.

2018-02-10: release 2.0.14

* In Export Programs, removed the hard-coded buffer size for the list of
  programs, so you should now see all your programs in the list, no matter how
  many there are.
* When Pasting complex numbers in a+bi notation, the imaginary unit must now be
  either i or j; the alternative spellings I and J are no longer recognized.

2018-02-06: release 2.0.13

* Paste didn't handle numbers with negative exponents correctly. Fixed.

2018-02-02: release 2.0.12d (iPhone only)

* Fixed crash in GIF printing.

2018-01-30: release 2.0.12c (Android only)

* Another fix for crash on orientation change while printing.

2018-01-29: release 2.0.12b (Android only)

* Switching between portrait and landscape modes, while printing was in
  progress, could cause a crash. Fixed.

2018-01-28: release 2.0.12a (Android only)

* Fixed handling of state files that were corrupted in a way that caused
  persistent crashes on the first keystroke.

2018-01-27: release 2.0.12

* Fixed pasting of SIZE lines.
* When pasting numbers, spaces are now allowed as thousands separators.
* Mac and MacDashboard versions: Are now 64-bit.
* Mac and Linux versions: Fixed Caps Lock handling, so Caps Lock + Esc no
  longer exits.
* Android and iPhone versions: Implemented "continuous on" mode (ON function,
  flag 44).

2018-01-26: release 2.0.11a (Android only)

* Removed the cleanup of variables in core_quit(); it looks like this was
  responsible for the failure mode where the app would crash at the first
  keystroke, consistently, forcing uninstall/reinstall.
* Pasting numbers that ended in CRLF, as when copying a single cell from Excel,
  didn't work; they were interpreted as strings. Fixed.

2018-01-14: release 2.0.11

* Copy now ignores flag 29 (thousands separators) and always copies numbers
  without separators. This fixes certain surprising / undesirable behaviors
  when pasting numbers into spreadsheets or programs.
* When entering a program line in NORM or TRACE modes, the line would be
  printed, even when printing was disabled. Fixed.
* MATA and MATB, in the SIMQ menu, would crash if the MATA or MATB variables
  were missing. Fixed, and also cleaned up type checks in MATX.
* Android version: Printing lots of output quickly, for example, by running a
  program in TRACE mode, would cause the user interface to become sluggish or
  even unresponsive on some devices. Fixed by posting UI updates less
  aggressively.

2018-01-07: release 2.0.10

* Program Paste without line numbers didn't handle certain numbers,
  specifically, those that started with a digit and didn't consist of only
  digits. Fixed.

2018-01-07: release 2.0.9

* Program Paste no longer requires line numbers.
* The CUSTOM command would toggle the CUSTOM menu, but that was wrong: it
  should only activate that menu, never deactivate it. Fixed.
* DIM?, EDIT, and EDITN didn't print X in TRACE mode. Fixed.
* Selecting the already-active menu did not cause the display to be repainted,
  even though it should: there might be a message, which should be removed in
  that case. Fixed.
* All versions except MacDashboard: made the print annunciator linger for one
  second after printing stops. This makes it more noticeable, so printing is
  less likely to go unnoticed on fast devices.
* Mac version: Implemented battery checker.
* Linux version: Added /sys/class/power_supply support in battery checker.

2017-12-26: release 2.0.8

* MENU (activating the programmable menu) while in ALPHA mode didn't turn off
  the alpha_mode flag, leading to bad behavior or even crashes if any menu keys
  were subsequently pressed.

2017-12-21: release 2.0.7c (Windows only)

* Decimal: SIN and COS of 45 degrees or 50 grads returned an inaccurate result,
  correct to only 16 digits. Fixed.

2017-12-18: release 2.0.7b (Android only)

* The "Always Paint Entire Display" setting, introduced in the previous
  version, didn't stick after app restart. Fixed.

2017-12-17: release 2.0.7a (Android only)

* Added "Always Paint Entire Display" option. This prevents display glitches
  with certain combinations of devices and skins.

2017-11-19: release 2.0.7

* Changed the RAN and SEED functions to match the behavior of the real HP-42S.
  The previous implementation used the algorithm from the HP-41C Standard Pac,
  which produced numbers with only 6 significant digits.
* The up/down annunciator (multi-row menu) did not get updated correctly when
  VARMENU was activated, including in the solver and integrator. Fixed.
* Windows version: Restored the Calculator key mapping option, which I had
  removed in 1.5.14. It turns out that keyboards with a dedicated Calculator
  key do still exist.
* Android version: The menu icons for Copy, Paste, and Print-Out were displayed
  too large, overlapping the menu item labels on some devices. Fixed.
* Windows, Linux, Mac, and MacDashboard versions: Added keyboard mappings
  g => GTO and p => PI. On existing installations, users must delete or rename
  the existing keymap and restart for this to take effect.
* iPhone version: Painting the display could be glitchy if either or both of
  its coordinates were odd. Fixed by forcing them to be even.

2017-08-12: release 2.0.6

* Decimal version: Fixed ISG and DSE for values >= 2^63 (9.2e18).
* Fixed a couple of bugs in how changes to internal SOLVE and INTEG data
  structures are handled.

2017-07-30: release 2.0.5

* Fixed INTEG termination condition. It would return inaccurate results in
  certain cases.
* Fixed importing numbers with exponent but no mantissa, e.g. E3, -E-5, etc.
  This got broken in 1.5.
* Fixed crash when trying to allocate ridiculously large matrices.
* While entering a numeric argument, the up-arrow and down-arrow keys would
  perform BST and SST, which should be blocked. Fixed.
* Testing flag 75 would turn on the programmable menu. Fixed.
* iPhone version: Fixed a few display alignment issues with the built-in 4"
  skin.

2017-05-29: release 2.0.4

* Implemented special-case code for pure real and pure imaginary numbers in all
  the complex logarithmic, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions.

2017-05-28: release 2.0.3

* Fixed a few edge cases in complex functions.
* The last digit in full-precision representation (SHOW, Copy) could be off by
  one in certain circumstances. Fixed.
* On cold start, now clearing flags 21 (printer enable) and 55 (printer
  existence), to match the behavior of the real HP-42S.
* Removed "raw text" print option; it has been obsolete since the introduction
  of UTF-8 printing in 1.5.11, since Unicode can represent the HP-42S character
  set directly.
* iPhone version: LOCAT didn't work when its initial invocation happened from a
  program. Fixed.
* In the About box, replaced the link to the Free42 discussion group with a
  link to the Alternative HP-42S/Free42 Manual.

2017-04-28: release 2.0.2

* In Unicode-to-HP conversion, translate "\LF" and "[LF]" to 10, not 138.
  Character 138 only exists to *represent* LF, but isn't available in the ALPHA
  menu and therefore cannot appear in non-synthetic programs.
* Unicode-to-HP conversion handles curly quotes now (U+2018, U+2019, U+201C,
  U+201D).

2017-04-23: release 2.0.1 (beta)

* Change right-pointing triangle from Unicode U+25B6 (black right-pointing
  triangle) to U+25B8 (black right-pointing small triangle); the former gets
  rendered as an emoji in iOS, while the latter doesn't, plus, the smaller
  triangle looks better in listings anyway.
* MacDashboard version: Fixed multi-line pasting.

2017-04-22: release 2.0 (beta)

* Copy & Paste now handle matrices, ALPHA mode, and PRGM mode.

2017-04-01: release 1.5.15

* Instead of being limited to 12 mantissa digits, full precision (34 digits in
  the Decimal version, 16 digits in Binary) is now supported for number entry,
  SHOW, Copy, and Paste.

2017-03-11: release 1.5.14

* Changed complex TAN and TANH to use more accurate formulae.
* The Time Module functions used to keep track of MDY/DMY modes using an
  invisible flag. For better HP-41 compatibility, they now use flag 31.
* Android version: Made state file writing more robust. If writing the state
  file fails, it now keeps the previous one, instead of leaving behind a
  partial or corrupt one.
* Linux version, Free42 Binary only: Some (recent?) versions of GTK set the
  LC_NUMERIC locale, which Free42 expects to always be "C". This causes number
  entry and display to be messed up in locales where the decimal is not ".",
  including most of Europe. I added code to force LC_NUMERIC back to "C" after
  gtk_init(), fixing this problem.
* Binary version: Fixed binary round-off problem in ADATE (for example,
  10.102010 would be rendered as 10/10/2009).

2017-01-22: release 1.5.13

* When DIM, SIZE, or SIMQ resize the indexed matrix, and when CLV deletes the
  indexed matrix, IJ should be set to (1, 1); and when DIM, SIZE, or SIMQ try
  to resize the matrix currently being edited by EDITN, and when CLV tries to
  delete the matrix currently being edited by EDITN, they should return a
  "Restricted Operation" error. Neither happened, creating the potential for
  memory corruption if IJ ended up pointing outside the matrix' data array.
  Fixed.
* STO and STO* allowed the target to be the matrix under edit by EDITN. They
  should not allow this, but return "Restricted Operation" instead. Fixed.
* CLALL didn't always exit all menus. Fixed.

2016-10-03: release 1.5.12

* Android version: Fixed UTF-8 printing, which was broken in 1.5.11.
* All versions: When printing to text, up-arrow now looks like an up-arrow,
  instead of a caret.

2016-10-01: release 1.5.11

* EXITALL didn't always exit all menus. Fixed.
* Print-to-text now emits UTF-8 encoded text, instead of ISO-8859-1.
* Print-to-text now emits CRLF line separators on all platforms.
* Android version: Didn't save the "raw text" print setting. Fixed.
* Android version: Added landscape skin; made it the default for landscape mode
  in new installs.

2016-09-04: release 1.5.10 (Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux)

* Fixed AGRAPH bug with complex number in X.

2016-09-04: release 1.5.9 (Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux)

* Now building the Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library from source for
  all targets. In terms of the end user, this makes no difference, but it will
  make life easier for people who want to port Free42 to platforms that I don't
  support myself (FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.); those platforms were left out in the
  cold when I started using the Intel library and only provided pre-built
  binaries for the supported platforms.
* Implemented range reduction for more accurate TAN in DEG and GRAD modes.
* Android version: Now handles orientation change more efficiently.

2016-04-26: release 1.5.8f (Android only)

* Rolled back 8e, which was a disaster; it didn't fix the remaining black
  line issues, but it did cause crashes everywhere.

2016-04-26: release 1.5.8e (Android only)

* The previous fix for the thin-black-line problem didn't do the job on some
  devices. Here's another fix that should do a better job.

2016-04-25: release 1.5.8d (Android only)

* Fixed the thin black lines that would sometimes appear around the display.
* In full-screen mode, swiping down from the top would post the menu, because
  the initial touch would be in the same area that Free42 watches as the menu
  trigger. I changed the code so that the trigger only fires if the user lifts
  their finger while still inside that critical area, which will only happen
  if the downward swipe is very short.
* Fixed the top-of-screen menu trigger so that it no longer sabotages keys
  that are also in that area, as in the HP_Mega_42 skin.

2016-04-24: release 1.5.8c (Android only)

* Implemented true full-screen mode. This hides the navigation bar as well the
  status bar, on devices running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later.

2016-04-23: release 1.5.8b (Android only)

* Print-Out is now scaled to make better use of available screen width.
* Fixed key clicks.
* Implemented Reverse Portrait (upside-down) mode.

2016-04-17: release 1.5.8a (Android only)

* Tapping in the top half of the display now brings up the app's option menu.

2016-04-17: release 1.5.8

* Entering an END into a program using the CUSTOM menu would leave the program
  counter at an invalid value, leading to memory corruption, state file
  corruption, and crashes. Fixed.
* Android version: Changed haptic feedback code back to using the old API.
* Android version: Changed targetSdkVersion from 3.0 to 2.2. This should make
  the menu reliably accessible in all Android versions and with all display
  styles.
* Resurrected the MacDashboard version; the display repaint logic now supports
  Yosemite (10.10) and later.

2016-03-19: release 1.5.7a (Android only)

* Made the action/title bar optional.
* Added full-screen mode (removes action/title bar and status bar).
* Added installLocation=auto to the manifest, so the app can now be installed
  on an SD card.

2016-02-28: release 1.5.7

* INSR should disable stack lift, but didn't. Fixed.
* Android version: Added Action Bar, reluctantly embracing the reality of
  devices with no menu button (or hard-to-find menu buttons, like the "press
  and hold the task switch button" behavior on some devices).

2014-12-21: release 1.5.6

* iPhone version: Implemented Copy and Paste.
* iPhone version: Fixed LOCAT for iOS 8.
* All versions, on hard reset, now initializing flag 28 (decimal point/comma)
  to match the host's locale.
* Paste didn't clear the message flags. Fixed.

2014-11-12: release 1.5.5

* Decimal version: Entering a number with an empty exponent (e.g. 1E or 1E-)
  would yield <Not a Number>. Fixed.
* iPhone version: HTTP server: Fixed downloading individual programs from, and
  uploading zip files of programs to, the /memory directory. This got broken in
  release 1.4.77, while implementing local file download.
* Android version: When the screen orientation was set to "automatic", it would
  not honor any system-wide orientation lock. Fixed.

2014-11-08: release 1.5.4a (Android only)

* Fixed crash on startup in Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
* Printing to text would truncate the file whenever it was reopened, opening it
  for writing rather than appending. Fixed.

2014-09-23: (no new code release)

* Added nova1_1096 skin, for iPhone 5, to the Free42iPhoneSkins package.
  Contributed by Keith Carangelo.

2014-09-06: release 1.5.4a (iPhone only)

* Fixed keyboard handling in the Preferences and Select File dialogs.
* Fixed scrolling behavior (in 1.5.4, windows were sized 20 pixels beyond the
  bottom of the screen, making the bottommost bit of scroll views drop off the
  screen).
* Added 4" skin for iPhone 5, and added code to select the best-fitting built-
  in skin on first launch.

2014-07-22: release 1.5.4

* Decimal version: Fixed ACOS. It would return 0 for acos(-1).
  This bug was introduced in release 1.5.

2014-06-21: release 1.5.3a (Android only)

* Made GPS optional. When I added the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in
  1.4.78, that had the side effect of making GPS a requirement. In 1.5.3a,
  the app manifest explicitly states that the GPS is not required.

2014-05-25: release 1.5.3

* Fixed crash in SIMQ if any of MATA, MATB, or MATX already existed and was a
  scalar or string.

2014-05-10: release 1.4.78 (Android only)

* Fixed the LOCAT function, by adding the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission.

2014-03-16: release 1.5.2

* Decimal version: Fixed Y^X for complex Y and negative integral X.
* Decimal version: Made Y^X and 10^X for real Y and integral X more accurate.
* All versions: sin(45°) now equals cos(45°), and sin(50grad) = cos(50grad).

2014-03-15: release 1.5.1

* All versions: Fixed ASIN, ACOS, and ATAN so they return exact results in DEG
  and GRAD modes for trivial parameters (asin(1), asin(-1), acos(0), atan(1),
  atan(-1), atan(infinity).
* Now displaying signed zero as zero, so you won't see -0 any more.
* Windows version: Removed the "Free42 Directory" setting from the Preferences.
  The application now looks for a file or directory named "portable" in the
  directory where Free42Decimal.exe or Free42Binary.exe itself is located; if
  it exists, the state.bin, print.bin, and keymap.txt files will be stored in
  this directory as well, and skins will only be loaded from this directory. If
  there is no "portable" item in the executable's directory, it will store
  state.bin, print.bin, and keymap.txt in %APPDATA%\Free42, and it will load
  skins from that directory, and from the executable's directory.

2014-03-09: release 1.5

* Decimal version: Switched from BCD20 to Intel's Decimal Floating-Point
  Library v2.1.
* Binary version: Replaced the old binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary
  conversions with code that uses the standard C library's equivalent
  functionality. This fixes final-digit errors in the Binary version, and also
  final-digit errors when switching from the Decimal to the Binary version.
* All versions: Added angle reduction code to make SIN, COS, and ->REC more
  accurate in DEG and GRAD modes.
* Windows version: Now uses %APPDATA%\Free42 as the default Free42 directory
  (for storing state.bin, print.bin, and keymap.txt). This avoids permissions
  problems when people install the executable in a directory to which they
  don't have write access (like the popular choice C:\Program Files).

2013-12-08: release 1.4.78

* All versions except Android: while parsing macros in skin layout files, tab
  characters were not recognized as whitespace and caused parsing to fail.
  Fixed.
* Linux version did not repaint the skin when it was switched from one skin to
  another with the same width and height. Fixed.
* Windows version: Downgraded my build environment from Visual C++ 2012 to 6.0.
  This means the Free42 build for Windows will run on older versions of Windows
  again.

2013-12-07: release 1.4.77a (Android only)

* Android version: The "external storage" filesystem is no longer referred to
  by the hard-coded path /sdcard, but using the external storage directory name
  provided by the Environment. This should help prevent problems like exporting
  programs and then not being able to find them from the PC.
* The file selection dialog will now append the file extension if the filename
  doesn't include it already.

2013-06-15: (no new code release)

* Three new skins, and many tweaks to existing skins, contributed by KD0GLS.
  The Free42Skins.zip, Free42iPhoneSkins.zip, and Free42AndroidSkins.zip
  packages were all updated.
* Added two new skins for large Android devices. Contributed by Tyge Loevset.

2013-06-08: (no new code release)

* Galaxy_Nexus skin to Android skins package. Contributed by Andrew Novinc.

2013-03-02: release 1.4.77a (iPhone only)

* iPhone version: Fixed "Make Directory" in the file selection dialogs.
* iPhone version: When the user turns off printing to text or to GIF in the
  Preferences, or changes the print-out file name, the existing files are now
  promptly flushed and closed.
* iPhone version: Fixed "garbage" in print-out window.
* iPhone version: Now highlights the currently selected skin in the Select Skin
  menu.

2013-02-17: release 1.4.77

* iPhone version: The links in the About view now actually work.
* iPhone version: Implemented 'New directory' and 'Delete' in the HTTP Server.
* iPhone version: Implemented zip file upload and download in the HTTP Server.
* iPhone version: Implemented local program import/export.
* iPhone version: Implemented print-out window.

2013-01-06: release 1.4.77

* All versions except iPhone: the links in the About boxes now actually work.

2013-01-01: release 1.4.76

* Mac version: Implemented print-out window.

2012-12-17: release 1.4.75b (iPhone only)

* iPhone version: Fixed three issues with the HTTP Server (displaying the wrong
  IP address, binding to the network incorrectly, and a crash when writing to
  the on-screen log).

2012-12-04: release 1.4.75a (iPhone only)

* iPhone version: Clicking Done on the HTTP Server window could cause the app
  to freeze under certain circumstances. Fixed.

2012-11-24: release 1.4.75

* Android version: Implemented haptic feedback option (vibrate on keypress).

2012-10-27: release 1.4.75

* iPhone version: In the HTTP Server view, tapping on the server URL switches
  between the DNS name and the IP address.
* Linux version: Now uses ALSA to play BEEP and TONE sounds (but not when
  running on remote displays).

2012-07-29: release 1.4.74b (Android only)

* Android version: Now writes state file when moved to background.

2012-05-06: release 1.4.74a (Android only)

* Android version: Fixed a couple of bugs that could cause crashes while
  printing.

2012-05-05: release 1.4.74

* Decimal version: The overflow fix in 1.4.73 was incorrect. This one works.

2012-05-05: release 1.4.73

* iPhone version: Now writes state file when moved to background.
* OFF now refuses to shut down Free42 if there have been no keystrokes since
  the application was started. It will stop program execution and display
  the message "Suspicious OFF" instead.
  This prevents code like LBL "OOPS"  SF 11  OFF  GTO "OOPS" from locking the
  user out.
* Decimal version: Overflows would return zero in some cases, i.e.
  9E9999 ENTER +. Fixed.

2012-04-15: release 1.4.72

* Android version: Added "skin smoothing" and "display smoothing" check boxes
  in the Preferences view.

2012-04-14: release 1.4.71

* HMS+ and HMS- would return results with the wrong sign under certain
  circumstances: result < 0 and |result| < 59 seconds, or result < 0 and
  |result| > maximum integer. Fixed.

2012-04-09: release 1.4.70b (Android only)

* Android version: Fixed app manifest so the app no longer obtains the
  READ_PHONE_STATE permission, which it never needed anyway.
  Some background: Apps targeted at Android 1.5 automatically get
  READ_PHONE_STATE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE when installed in Android 1.6 or
  higher, without the user being told, and this tends to look under-handed to
  users who aren't aware of what's going on. Free42 now targets 1.6, which
  means it doesn't get any permissions silently.
  It does now request WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, because it needs it for printing
  to files and for exporting programs.
  Note that the app still runs on 1.5 and later; the requirements for running
  it have not changed.

2012-02-12: release 1.4.70a (Android only)

* Android version: Fixed app manifest to make the app work with screens other
  than 320x480. This should fix the problem of skins not filling the whole
  screen on some devices.

2011-09-18: release 1.4.70

* Fixed several bugs in complex ASIN, ASINH, ACOS, and ACOSH.
* Android version: Better printer icon in the main menu, by Günter Schink.
* Mac version: OFF didn't work when invoked from a program. Fixed.

2011-06-11: (no new code release)

* Added two new skins to the Android skins package, designed for the Samsung
  Galaxy S 9000, which has an 800x480 screen. Contributed by Günter Schink.

2011-05-22: (no new code release)

* Added Free42AndroidSkins.zip package, for skins designed for Android-based
  devices; added HTC4800 skin for HTC Desire HD or other Android devices with
  480x800 screens. Skin contributed by Michael Vogel, based on an iPhone skin
  by Jerrod Hofferth.

2011-04-22: release 1.4.69 (Android only)

* Added "orientation" option in Preferences, allowing the user to lock the app
  in landscape or portrait mode.
* Improved the layout of the file selection and Preferences dialogs.
* The file selection dialog no longer disables files that don't match the
  filter; it now hides them.

2011-04-20: release 1.4.68

* INVRT did not perform any type checks, leading to badness when it was applied
  to anything that wasn't a matrix. Fixed.

2011-04-10: (no new code release)

* Added six new skins to the iPhone skins package. Contributed by Javier
  Goizueta.

2011-03-13: release 1.4.67

* ASIN returned incorrect results for large complex arguments. Fixed.
* iPhone version: Added support for 640x920 skins.
* Added Silver And Blue skin to Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package. Contributed by
  David Geiger.
* The SST and BST key labels were switched in these skins:
  ppcskins/Andy480x800.gif ppcskins/Ramos240x400.gif ppcskins/Ramos480x640.gif
  ppcskins/SilverAndBlue.gif ppcskins/StandardPPC.gif
  ppcskins/StandardPPCsm.gif skins/Andy480x800.gif
  Fixed.

2010-04-08: release 1.4.66

* Removed the "Not Yet Implemented" Time functions; I decided not to implement
  them. They're also gone from the FCN catalog.
  The ADATE, ATIME, ATIME24, CLK12, CLK24, DATE, DATE+, DDAYS, DMY, DOW, MDY,
  and TIME functions remain; those are the time/date-related functions from the
  HP-41 Time Module that are actually useful in Free42.
  The functions that I decided not to implement after all are the following:
  Live clock display: CLKT CLKTD CLOCK
  Stopwatch: RCLSW RUNSW SETSW STOPSW SW
  Alarms: ALMCAT ALMNOW XYZALM
  Clock control: CORRECT RCLAF SETAF SETDATE SETIME T+X
* In DMY mode, DATE would display dates as DD:MM:YYYY, but that should be
  DD.MM.YYYY. Fixed.

2010-04-03: release 1.4.65

* Implemented some more Time Module functions: ADATE, ATIME, ATIME24, CORRECT,
  RCLAF, SETAF, SETDATE, SETIME, T+X.

2010-03-30: release 1.4.64

* Implemented some more Time Module functions: DATE+, DDAYS, and DOW.

2010-03-28: release 1.4.63

* iPhone version: Implemented ACCEL, LOCAT, and HEADING functions, for querying
  the device's accelerometer, location services (GPS on the 3G and 3GS; WiFi-
  based on all other models), and compass (3GS only).
* All versions except MacDashboard: for skins, increased the maximum macro
  length from 31 to 63. The old limit was too small to allow macros that step
  forward all the way to the end of the FCN catalog, and supporting such macros
  is necessary now that the length of the FCN catalog is no longer fixed at 42
  rows.
* Also, changed several macros in the HP-41 and HP42CY skins where the FCN
  catalog was being traversed backwards, replacing N repetitions of "up" with
  42-N repetitions of "down", so they will work correctly in the presence of an
  extended FCN catalog. (None of the other skins currently in the Free42
  repository traverse the FCN catalog backwards, so they don't need updating.)
* PalmOS version: Turning off printing did not flush the GIF file, so you'd end
  up with a truncated image. Fixed.
* When COMPLEX is executed with a complex number or complex matrix in X, and
  POLAR mode is active, it is possible for range errors to occur. Free42 would
  simply substitute POS_HUGE_VAL in such cases, but that was incorrect; it
  should report Out of Range or substitute POS_HUGE_VAL depending on the
  setting of flag 24. Fixed.
* R/S can now be pressed using the PC keyboard even when ALPHA mode is active.

2010-03-07: release 1.4.62

* Windows version: Now has an option in the Preferences screen to map the
  Calculator key, found on many newer keyboards, to launch Free42.
* iPhone version: The hostname lookup for the HTTP Server window is now done in
  a background thread, so that a slow or malfunctioning DNS server no longer
  causes the app to freeze on startup.
* When EDITN was active, you could overwrite the edited matrix with a scalar
  using STO, or delete it using CLV -- and then you would be stuck in the
  Matrix Editor, and even CLALL couldn't get you out. Fixed; you will now get
  the Restricted Operation message when you try to change or delete the active
  matrix behind EDITN's back.

2009-12-29: (no new code release)

* Added HP-41 skin to the Free42Skins.zip package. This skin mimics the HP-41
  layout, and includes many macros to map additional functions to the keyboard.
  Contributed by Guenny.

2009-11-25: release 1.4.61

* Decimal version: ->OCT (decimal-to-octal conversion) was broken; it actually
  converted octal to decimal. Fixed.

2009-11-11: (no new code release)

* Added HP42CY skin to the Free42Skins.zip package. This skin includes many
  macros to map additional functions to the keyboard. Contributed by Guenny.
* Added kacskin and kacskin_yellow skins to the Free42Skins.zip package.
  These are slightly modified versions of Michaels HP, and may be easier to
  read on some screens. Contributed by Keith Carangelo.

2009-11-08: release 1.4.60

* Decimal version: SQRT could be off by 1 in the final digit. It now computes
  one additional digit and rounds it into the mantissa, which should make it
  accurate in all cases.
* Decimal version: The BCDFloat add and subtract functions could return
  denormalized results when one of the arguments was zero. Free42 would not
  display these denormalized numbers correctly, leading to strange results like
  1.0001 LOG returning something that looked like zero but wasn't. Fixed.

2009-10-31: release 1.4.59

* MacDashboard version: Changed the background from green to gray, and changed
  the transparency to fully opaque.
* PalmOS Decimal version builds & works again; fixed the SQRT crash and the
  divide bug (caused by 16-bit integer overflow, oops).
* Decimal version: Re-fixed the subtract bug which had originally been fixed in
  1.4.53, but reappeared in the great BCDFloat/BCDFloat2 refactoring.
* Decimal version: 1e-10000 LOG and 1e-10000 LN returned <Not a Number>. Fixed.
* CLV and PRV didn't work from the CUSTOM menu, potentially even causing a
  crash. Fixed.

2009-10-24: release 1.4.58

* Removed Byron's BIGSTACK and BIGLCD hacks; these will be maintained in a
  separate fork from now on. This protects the other Free42 versions from bugs
  in the 42S/iPhone code, and right now, it fixes some display glitches in the
  other versions.

2009-10-19: release 1.4.57

* New LOG code (again), for exact results when the argument is a power of 10.
  The bug from version 1.4.55 is fixed.
* Subtract would lose one digit of precision for edge cases like
  1 - 0.9999999999999999999999999; fixed.

2009-10-12: release 1.4.56

* The new LOG implementation introduced in Decimal version 1.4.55 was broken;
  rolling back to 1.4.54 version. (Note that this means that powers of 10 do
  not yield exact results, but at least everything *else* is OK again now.)

2009-10-10: release 1.4.55

* Some improvements in the new BCDFloat code:
  . LOG (common log) is now precise for powers of 10.
  . MOD function now works for large arguments.
  . rounding fix in multiply now gets 1/3*3-1 and 10/3*3-10 the same answer,
    10/7*7-10 is not the same, but this is correct (it depends on where you cut
    off the number).
  . optimisations to subtract routine.
* Mac version: Now uses $HOME/Library/Application Support/Free42 instead of
  $HOME/.free42 for persistent state, keymap, and skins. If this directory
  does not exist, but $HOME/.free42 does, the latter is renamed to the former.
* Switching from a version using the old BCDFloat code (1.4.51 or earlier) to a
  version using the new code (1.4.52 or later) wasn't handled properly; it
  should handle the change in how Infinities and NaNs are represented, but it
  didn't. This is related to the problem fixed in 1.4.54.
  Starting with this version, all state files created by versions 1.4.51 and
  older are assumed to contain old-style BCDFloat, and state files created by
  versions 1.4.52 and newer are assumed to contain new-style BCDFloat.
  This means that BCDFloat numbers created by all previous versions of Free42
  Decimal will now be interpreted correctly, however, any state file that has
  become damaged by upgrading from <= 1.4.51 Decimal to 1.4.52-54 will still
  be damaged, and the only way to make sure no such damage remains is to do
  CLALL and reload all programs and data.

         to| <=51| <=51|52-53|52-53|  54 |  54 | >=55| >=55

  LEGEND: This chart shows compatibility between Free42 state file versions. To
  check if version A will correctly handle state files produced by version B,
  check the cell at column A, row B. The numbers 51..55 in the chart refer to
  Free42 releases 1.4.51 through 1.4.55.
  A 'c' means you will get a "State File Corrupt" message; "+" means the state
  file will be read correctly, and "-" means the state file will be read, but
  some numbers will be converted incorrectly.
  Note that once the Free42 state has become damaged by an upgrade marked with
  "-" in this chart, it will stay damaged; so, for example, upgrading from
  1.4.51 Decimal to 1.4.52 Decimal, and then to 1.4.55 Decimal, may result in a
  damaged state, while upgrading from 1.4.51 Decimal to 1.4.55 Decimal directly
  will not.

2009-08-28: release 1.4.54

* The new BCDFloat code, introduced in version 1.4.52, uses a different
  convention for representing NaN and infinities: instead of using special
  values in the exponent, it now uses dedicated flags, and has a narrower
  exponent field. The code that converts between decimal and binary, when
  switching between Free42 Decimal and Free42 Binary while keeping the same
  state file, did not deal with this new convention, and, as a result,
  switching between those versions could cause numbers to become NaN or
  Infinity when they shouldn't.
  This release fixes this. It is only relevant to those who switch between
  Free42 Decimal and Free42 Binary.

2009-08-17: release 1.4.53

* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in the subtract routine that could cause
  incorrect, malformed results in some cases, e.g. 4 ENTER 3 / 1 - 3 * 1 -
  returned -:.E-25.

2009-08-08: release 1.4.52

* New: Mac version. This is a native application, not a Dashboard widget; it
  is functionally identical to the PC versions (Windows, GTK, and Motif).
  The print-out window doesn't work yet, though printing to files does;
  everything else is working. The print-out window will be finished in a two
  or three weeks, barring the unforeseen. I'm releasing the app in this
  incomplete state because I feel it is stable and usable, and should be a
  big improvement for those currently using the Dashboard widget.
  This is a Universal application, so it should run on PowerPC and Intel-
  based Macs. It requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
* Decimal version: Merged Hugh Steers' latest BCD code. This provides more
  accurate transcendentals and some bug fixes.
* Also, Hugh improved the error estimate for the Romberg integration code;
  it now converges more quickly in many cases.
* MacDashboard version: Now recognizes '*' and '+' on the numeric keypad.

2009-07-10: release 1.4.51

* Changed the homepage URL to http://thomasokken.com/free42/.

2009-06-29: release 1.4.50

* Adding or subtracting two complex matrices, and adding or subtracting a
  complex matrix in X to or from a complex scalar in Y, would cause memory
  corruption, resulting in a crash soon after. Fixed.

2009-06-13: (no new code release)

* Added "Realistic42s240x400" skin for 240x400 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package). Contributed by Denis Cesar.

2009-06-07: release 1.4.49

* BASE/ tried to catch division by zero by looking at Y instead of X. Oops! The
  result was that 0/1 would return "Divide by 0" and 1/0 would cause Free42 to
  crash. Fixed.
* PalmOS version: Tall skins can now be selected on all devices, regardless of
  whether they have tall screens or not. On most devices, this isn't useful,
  but the tallness check had the effect of suppressing the 320x450 Ehrling42sm
  skin on the Tapwave Zodiac, which has a 480x320 screen; the result was that
  you couldn't use that skin even if you switched to portrait mode.

2009-05-05: (no new code release)

* Added "Ramos240x400" skin for 240x400 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package). Contributed by Miguel Toro; based on
  Ramos480x640 by Noe Ramos.

2009-04-04: release 1.4.48

* Fixed PSE; it no longer freezes the UI for one second, but uses a proper
  timeout, so event processing can continue, and keystrokes during PSE have
  the proper effect (of stopping program execution and then being handled
  normally).

2009-03-04: release 1.4.47

* Another UVEC bug: it should return Invalid Data when the magnitude of its
  argument (|z| for complex scalars, FNRM for real matrices) is zero. It
  returned its argument unchanged instead. Fixed.

2009-02-22: release 1.4.46

* UVEC returned Invalid Type for complex scalar arguments. Fixed; it now returns
  z/|z| (same as the SIGN function for such arguments), like the real HP-42S.
* When functions with arguments, e.g. STO, FIX, etc., were entered into a
  program from the CUSTOM menu, they would get inserted before the current
  program line instead of after. Fixed.

2009-01-28: release 1.4.45

* ASTO IND ST X was broken; instead of storing the first 6 characters of the
  ALPHA register into the register or variable pointed to by X, it stored them
  into the variable pointed to by the first six characters of ALPHA itself.
  Fixed.

2009-01-14: (no new code release)

* Added "Lienhard480x800" skin for 480x800 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package). Contributed by Thomas Lienhard.
* Added "Sven320x240mini" skin for 320x240 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package). This skin only shows the keys for basic
  arithmetic and stack manipulation, making the keys large enough to use easily
  without a stylus. Contributed by Sven from Vienna.
* Added "Ramos480x640" skin for 480x640 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package). It has a distinctive, sparse look.
  Contributed by Noe Ramos.

2008-08-16: release 1.4.44

* Made auto-repeat for number entry and ALPHA modes optional. The auto-repeat
  feature, introduced in release 1.4.11, is not found on the real HP-42S, and
  can cause problems if you don't expect this kind of behavior in a calculator.
  It can now be turned off in the Preferences dialog, though the default is
  still for it to be on.
  Note that this is unrelated to the auto-repeat for the 'up' and 'down' keys,
  which is authentic HP-42S behavior, and cannot be turned off.

2008-04-12: release 1.4.43

* MacDashboard version: Fixed event handling so that program execution now
  works. There's still plenty of room for improvement: key timeouts (so
  pressing and holding a key behaves like it does on the real HP-42S and on
  the other Free42 versions) and auto-repeat come to mind... But at least
  programs, the solver, the integrator, and interruptible matrix functions
  should all be usable now.

2008-03-10: release 1.4.42

* Pocket PC version: I added a HI_RES_AWARE resource so that Free42 will now be
  able to take advantage of high-resolution displays without the help of
  Tweaks2k2 or similar utilities.

2008-01-11: (no new code release)

* Added "Khor" skin for Windows and Unix versions (Free42Skins.zip package).
  Contributed by Michael Khor.

2008-01-01: release 1.4.41

* PalmOS version: When opening the print-out database fails with a 0x0209 error
  (database corrupt), it now deletes the database, creates a new one, and tries
  again.

2007-12-15: release 1.4.40

* The 'Paste' command now handles binary, octal, and hexadecimal values when
  the calculator is in the respective base modes. Note that 'Copy' has
  supported non-decimal bases since times immemorial, so this simply makes
  clipboard handling consistent at last.

2007-12-15: release 1.4.39

* Windows version: The single-instance option did not work when the previous
  instance was minimized. Fixed.

2007-12-14: release 1.4.38

* Windows, GTK and Motif versions: Implemented single-instance option. This is
  on by default in the Windows version, but off by default in the GTK and Motif
  versions, since many X11 window managers won't let clients raise themselves.
  (PalmOS is single-tasking, and Pocket PC enforces single-instance behavior
  for all applications, so this option does not apply to those environments.)

2007-12-08: release 1.4.37

* Changed the homepage URL to http://free42.sourceforge.net/.

2007-08-15: (no new code release)

* The Motif version did not compile under Ubuntu 64-bit; its version of g++
  considers the loss of precision that occurs when casting a void* to an int to
  be a fatal error, and motif/shell_main.cc used such casts in two places
  (those casts were legit -- not a bug!). I fixed shell_main.cc so that it
  first casts to a long, then to an int: the loss of precision when casting
  between integer types is not frowned upon, so this should compile anywhere
  with no errors or warnings.
  I'm only updating the free42.tgz package, and not releasing any new
  executables, since this code change does not actually affect any of the
  existing builds.

2007-07-28: (no new code release)

* Added "Ehrling42ss240sq" and "SemiReal240sq" skins for 240x240 Pocket PC
  devices (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package).
* Added information about keyboard mapping to the README files for Pocket PC,
  Windows, Motif, and GTK.

2007-05-12: release 1.4.36

* PalmOS 68k version: Under PalmOS < 3.2, importing and exporting programs
  would cause a crash, because I was using a Progress Manager API that did not
  yet exist in those versions. Fixed now; as it turns out, I never needed that
  newer API in the first place; the PalmOS 3.0 version does the job just fine.

2007-05-06: release 1.4.35

* Binary version: AIP would mangle some numbers; the underlying function to
  extract the digit in a number's units position was broken. Fixed.
* Decimal version: Modified BCDFloat::_usub() so that it performs the
  subtraction using an extended (8-digit) mantissa. This fixes the behavior of
  borderline cases like 0.9999999999999999999999999 - 1 (used to yield 0, now
  -1e-25) and 1 - 1e-25 (used to yield 1, now 0.9999999999999999999999999).

2007-04-04: (no new code release)

* The "Standard" skin for the PalmOS version (Free42PalmOSSkins.zip package)
  had the labels for SST and BST switched. Fixed.
  
2007-04-01: release 1.4.34

* SOLVER: when the Ridders algorithm made no further progress, because the
  interpolated value coincided with one of the interval's endpoints, it would
  use the interpolated value as the final estimate of the root, without
  checking if it was in fact the best estimate; the best estimate can
  sometimes be the opposite endpoint. Added a check to make sure the best
  estimate is returned.
* GTK and Motif versions: Now set the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property on all top-level
  windows, to allow window managers to use different policies on the various
  windows depending on their role. This property is set to "Free42 Calculator"
  for the main window, "Free42 Print-Out" for the print-out window, and to
  "Free42 Dialog" for all dialogs.

2007-03-23: release 1.4.33

* PalmOS ARM version: Would not run on some Palm Tungsten T models, because
  they report an incorrect ROM version number. Made the version number check a
  bit more lenient so that it will accept "Development" versions as well as
  "Release" versions.

2007-03-20: (no new code release)

* Added "StandardPPCsm" skin for 240x240 Pocket PC devices
  (Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package).

2007-02-27: release 1.4.32

* When the BASE application was active, the arithmetic keys and +/- would be
  reassigned the BASE+, BASE-, BASE*, BASE/, and BASE+/- functions -- which is
  good, but these assignments would stay in effect even if a non-application
  menu was active on top of BASE, and that was wrong. Fixed now.

2007-02-18: release 1.4.31

* Decimal version: Floating-point addition would return an incorrectly rounded
  result under certain circumstances. Fixed.

2007-02-14: release 1.4.30

* INTEG reported the difference between the final iteration and the one before
  in the Y register (the error estimate), but without taking the absolute
  value first. As a result, the reported accuracy could be negative. Fixed.

2007-01-27: release 1.4.29

* Decimal version: Did not handle numbers without mantissa correctly while
  importing programs (i.e. lines like "E4"; see the notes for release 1.3.5).
  The binary version has handled this kind of thing correctly since release
  1.3.5, but the decimal version did not. Fixed.

2007-01-06: release 1.4.28

* INTEG used to treat ACC as an absolute error bound, but that is not
  consistent with the behavior of the real HP-42S. Fixed; it is now treated as
  a relative error.

2006-11-11: (no new code release)

* Added "Realism" skin for high-density (320x320 and higher) PalmOS devices
  (Free42PalmOSSkins.zip package). Contributed by Curtis Cameron.

2006-08-21: release 1.4.27

* The int2string() function did not handle numbers with more than 9 digits
  correctly. This caused MEM to display gibberish on machines with more than
  999,999,999 bytes of available physical memory.
  Fixed; also, the code now interprets free memory as an unsigned number,
  rather than signed, so that free memory up to 4,294,967,295 bytes should now
  be reported correctly.

2006-07-11: release 1.4.26

* PalmOS ARM version: Paste didn't work; it caused a Fatal Exception instead.
  Fixed.

2006-06-21: release 1.4.25

* Motif version: Now gets the selected items from the Export Program dialog
  using the XmListGetSelectedPos() function, rather than using the
  selectedPositionCount and selectedPositions resources; those resources are
  a Motif 2.0 feature, and are not supported by the Lesstif library. With this
  change, Export Program now works with Lesstif as well as with OpenMotif.

2006-06-19: release 1.4.24

* Under certain conditions, SOLVE would return not the final value in X, but
  the previous one (which is also returned in Y). Fixed.
* Pocket PC version: Now building the CAB files using the Cabwiz.exe from the
  PPC 2002 SDK, instead of the PPC 2003 SDK. Hopefully this will fix the
  problem of Free42 not installing properly on some PPC 2002 devices.

2006-06-09: release 1.4.23

* PalmOS version: Fixed a bug that would cause reading the state file to fail
  if there were no variables.
* GTK version: The position of the print-out window would not be remembered if
  it was closed when the application exited. It appears that the
  gtk_window_get_position() function returns the original postition (from the
  window's geometry hints) if it is called while the window is not mapped.
  I'm now working around this by making sure I get the window position while
  the print-out window is actually mapped.
* Windows version: Show Print-Out did not work when the Print-Out window was
  minimized. Fixed.
* Decimal version: Changed the definition of POS_HUGE_PHLOAT and
  NEG_HUGE_PHLOAT to have a mantissa with 25 nines, rather than 28. (These are
  the numbers that are returned when a range error occurs while flag 24 is
  set.)
* CLALL did not clear the CUSTOM menu and the programmable menu. Fixed.
* STO+, STO-, and STO/, where the destination was the indexed matrix, would
  reset I and J, but that was wrong (only STO and STO* should do that, since
  only they can actually cause the destination's dimensions to change).
  This caused the MLR program from the HP-42S Programming Examples and
  Techniques book to return incorrect results. Fixed.
* In HEXM and OCTM modes, SHOW should display X in decimal, but it showed it in
  the selected base instead. On the real HP-42S, SHOW only shows the number in
  base in BINM mode, and in decimal in all other modes. Fixed.

2006-05-22: release 1.4.22

* Decimal version: Numbers are always rounded to 25 decimal digits now. The 7-
  digit base-10000 representation, which Free42 uses internally, is equivalent
  to 25 to 28 decimal digits, but the extra digits tend to introduce noise
  which can interfere with the convergence tests of certain iterative numerical
  algorithms. Rounding to 25 decimal digits makes Free42 behave like a regular
  decimal calculator, preventing such problems.
* GTK version: Explicitly realizes the print widget now, which prevents GTK
  warnings being written to the console when print instructions are performed
  before the print-out window is first opened.

2006-05-20: release 1.4.21

* Decimal version: For values < 1e-8, SQRT returned results that were a factor
  10000 too large. This was due to a bug in the underlying BCDFloat::sqrt()
  method, which probably affected other functions as well. Fixed.

2006-05-19: (no new code release)

* Added "HP-42C" voyager-style skins for Windows and Unix (Free42Skins.zip
  package). Contributed by Egan Ford.

2006-05-11: release 1.4.20

* GTK version: Added periodic battery check (once per minute). The other
  versions already had this. Note that the GTK and Motif versions use /proc/apm
  to inspect battery status; on systems without /proc/apm, this check does not
  work, and the battery is assumed to always be OK. /proc/acpi support is not
  implemented yet.
* All versions except PalmOS: the keyboard handling changes in release 1.4.17
  broke auto-repeat from the PC keyboard. Fixed.

2006-05-08: (no new code release)

* HP-41 to HP-42S character code conversion in the rom2raw program did not
  work; alpha LBL, GTO, XEQ, and string program lines were not converted.
  Fixed, and updated the free42.tgz and rom2raw.zip packages.

2006-05-07: release 1.4.19

* GTK version: Auto-start (flag 11) did not work. Fixed.
* Auto-start did not work if the program counter was at line 00. Fixed.
* When auto-start causes program execution to begin while PRGM mode is active,
  any pending command should be cancelled and PRGM mode should be exited before
  program execution starts. This wasn't handled properly; fixed now.

2006-05-01: release 1.4.18

* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in exp() that caused it to return wrong results
  for very large negative parameters. This affects E^X, SINH, COSH, and TANH.
* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in TANH that caused it to return NaN or other
  nonsense for very large parameters.
* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in the BCD20 library that caused -Infinity not
  to be recognized as a negative number.

2006-05-01: release 1.4.17

* Pocket PC version: Fixed a couple of cosmetic bugs in menu key highlighting.
* Added support for CShift mappings. These are keyboard mappings that take
  effect if the Calculator's Shift annunciator is on. This makes it possible
  for [CShift] [Key] to activate a different keystroke or macro than the
  unshifted [Key], so you can, for example, make CShift SQRT be something other
  than X^2.
* Display repainting is temporarily disabled during macro playback, to prevent
  distracting "flashing" for complex macros.

2006-04-23: (no new code release)

* Added 160x160 version of the Standard skin to the Free42PalmOSSkins.zip
  package.

2006-04-22: release 1.4.16

* Complex matrices took up twice as much memory as they actually needed, due to
  an erroneous extra multiplication by 2 while allocating the memory chunk for
  the matrix elements. Fixed.
* Shared matrices now remain shared even after application exit and restart.
* PalmOS version: Removed the 64 kilobyte matrix size limit. Matrix size is now
  limited only by available application heap space. (On PalmOS < 3.5, the 64k
  limit still exists.)

2006-04-13: release 1.4.15

* Windows and Pocket PC versions: When print commands were executed before the
  print-out window was created, the scroll-back buffer would not grow properly.
  Fixed.

2006-04-11: release 1.4.14

* PalmOS version: Tweaked the layout of the Preferences dialog a bit. The
  version for PalmOS < 3.5 was particularly bad.
* PalmOS ARM version: Export Program would only export the first program in
  memory, and write garbage (or even freeze) for any others that were selected.
  Fixed.

2006-04-10: release 1.4.13

* New: ARM-native PalmOS version. It's not for everyone -- it's big, it starts
  up much slower than the 68k version, and of course you need a Palm with an
  ARM CPU -- but once it gets going, it's pretty fast!
  Note that the ARM state file is not compatible with the 68K version, so
  whenever you switch from the 68K version to the ARM version or back, you will
  get the "State File Corrupt" message. Be sure to export all important
  programs before switching!
* Implemented instance caching for scalars and strings. This eliminates the
  memory management overhead from most simple instructions and speeds up
  program execution.

2006-04-04: release 1.4.12

* Pocket PC version: Implemented proper beeper.

2006-04-04: release 1.4.11

* Implemented auto-repeat for number entry and ALPHA modes.
* In the previous release, I broke the annunciators in the Standard skin for
  the Pocket PC. Fixed.

2006-04-03: release 1.4.10

* Pocket PC version: Made orange (shifted) legends in the Standard skin a bit
  larger. The original 5x4 characters were way too small; hopefully the new 7x5
  characters will be more to people's liking.
* Tweaked the PalmOS version of the Ehrling42sm skin a little: I increased the
  vertical key spacing by 4 pixels. It has a more balanced appearance now;
  should be nicer to use, too.
* PalmOS version: Changed the display background color in the Ehrling42sm,
  SemiReal42, SemiReal42HD, and SemiAuto42HD skins, from LCD greenish to gray.
  The reason is that the standard PalmOS 8-bit palette does not contain the
  right shade of green, so in the skin bitmaps, the color ended up becoming
  gray anyway; displaying the actual LCD contents on top of it (which happens
  in true color on devices that support it) then gives an ugly appearance.
  I modified skin2prc so that it can now also generate true-color (16-bit) skin
  bitmaps, but those tend to get pretty big, so I'm not using that
  functionality yet while building the Free42PalmOSSkins.zip package; maybe
  later, I'll create separate true-color versions of Ehrling42sm etc. to keep
  the fans of green happy...

2006-04-02: release 1.4.9

* PalmOS version: Optimized display updating code. For high-density skins,
  display updates are now about 3 times faster than before; this should make
  HD skins much more usable (more responsive).
* PalmOS version: Added support for tall (320x450) skins.
* Added new "realistic" 320x450 skin to Free42PalmOSSkins.zip package. It's
  not great; just a quick-and-dirty, proof-of-concept adaptation of Ehrling42sm
  from the Windows/Unix skin collection.

2006-04-01: release 1.4.8

* Changed implementations of X<=Y? and X>=Y? so they now actually return x<=y
  and x>=y, respectively; formerly, they returned !(x>y) and !(x<y), which is
  fine in most cases, except when NaNs are involved.
* Decimal versions: Rewrote BCDFloat comparison functions so they now handle
  NaNs properly; also, inequalities now return correct results for numbers
  whose difference is too small to represent (e.g. 1.1e-10000 1e-10000 X<Y?
  used to return 'false', because it would subtract the two numbers and then
  compare the result to 0 -- with no check for underflow).

2006-04-01: release 1.4.7

* Decimal versions: In BCDFloat::mul(), multiplications by zero could return
  values with zero mantissas (good) but nonzero exponents (bad). After several
  such multiplications, the exponents could get into the "special" ranges (i.e.
  Infinities and NaNs). Result: 0 * 0 => NaN, etc. Fixed.
* Fixed BCDFloat::sub() so that it will not return -0. It used to do that when
  computing 0 - 0. I think this was harmless, but I fixed it anyway.
* Added new Pocket PC skin with single-click activation of shifted functions to
  Free42PocketPCSkins.zip package. Contributed by Jeff O.

2006-03-26: release 1.4.6

* New: Pocket PC version.
* Added a new voyager-style skin to the Free42Skins.zip package (Windows and
  Unix), and created a new package, Free42PocketPCSkins.zip, with skins
  specifically designed for the Pocket PC.
* ->POL now detects the case that the real and/or imaginary parts are zero, and
  returns exact results for those cases.
* Canceling a partially-entered DEL, LIST, or PRP command in PRGM mode could
  cause the instruction pointer to be set to an invalid location. Fixed.

2006-03-19: release 1.4.5

* Decimal version: 1 ACOS returned <Not a Number> instead of 0. Fixed.

2006-03-13: release 1.4.4

* GTK version: When initially presented, the print-out window was not
  automatically scrolled to the bottom sometimes. Fixed.
* GTK version: When the print-out window's scroll-back buffer was full, and the
  window was not scrolled to the bottom, and print-out took place, the window
  would get updated wrong. Fixed.
* In TRACE mode, while running a program, clearing flag 21 should not suppress
  auto-print, but it did. Fixed.
* The "Paste" command no longer uses sscanf() to parse real or complex numbers;
  instead, it now uses the same string-to-number conversion code that is used
  when the user enters a number on the keyboard. This means that numbers like
  0.1 can now be pasted in the Decimal version with no binary round-off error.

2006-03-12: release 1.4.3

* GTK version: Refused to close the print-out window. Fixed.

2006-03-11: release 1.4.2

* New: GTK+ version. For Unix users who think Motif is not cool enough. ;-)
* Fixed handling of large complex arguments in ABS and SIGN.
* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in BCDFloat addition and subtraction that could
  cause the result to be rounded wrong under certain circumstances.
* Some minor maintenance stuff: changed the type of BASE (in bcdfloat.h) from
  'long' back to 'int' in order to make the PalmOS code slightly more
  efficient; removed the -O2 option from the MinGW makefile, because the
  optimizer was breaking the solver.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the PalmOS version to fail while converting
  programs from decimal to binary.

2006-03-03: release 1.4.1

* Decimal version: Fixed a bug in BCDFloat addition and subtraction that could
  cause the result to have the wrong sign under certain circumstances.
  This seems to have fixed the poor SOLVE performance; apparently that was
  *not* caused by transcendentals not being evaluated to the full 28 digits.
* PalmOS version: When entering text using Graffiti, case switching is now
  performed even on Graffiti 2.

2006-02-27: release 1.4

* Added decimal floating point, implemented using BCDFloat code by Hugh Steers.
  The decimal code is a compile-time option; I can (and will!) still build
  Free42 with binary floating point as well.
* Removed "IP Hack" option. It never really did the job anyway, and with the
  introduction of the Decimal version, it is now obsolete.
* VIEW, AVIEW, and ADV now talk to the printer when invoked from the keyboard,
  even if flag 21 is clear.
* In TRACE mode, when the X register is printed automatically (not because of
  an explicit PRX), and it contains a matrix, print only the matrix descriptor,
  not its whole contents.
* Fixed handling of large complex arguments in LOG and LN.
* Windows version: The default location for the Free42 directory is once again
  the executable's directory. This change only affects new installations; the
  Free42 directory location is still stored in the Registry, and any already
  existing setting will be honored.
* On hard reset, the printer is enabled now (flags 21 and 55 are set instead of
  cleared). This is not what the real HP-42S does, but, then again, the real
  HP-42S does not have a built-in printer, while Free42 does; this new behavior
  should be more intuitive.
  (Note: flags 21 and 55, and the PRON and PROFF commands, still work as
  before; the only change is their initial setting.)
* Fixed a crash that could occur when ridiculously large numbers were used for
  indirect addressing (meaning numbers >= 2147483648 absolute).

2006-02-10: release 1.3.17

* Clicking in the display now only activates softkeys if a menu is active. This
  means that programs that "fake" menus by painting in the display and calling
  GETKEY are no longer supported -- but then again, you can still use the top
  six keys of the keyboard in that case, and for all I know there is only one
  program on the whole planet that actually does a fake menu (hi Erik :-) ).
* Code import now converts "" (empty string, a synthetic HP-41 construct) to
  |-"", instead of dropping it on the floor. This is consistent with the
  behavior of "" on the 41: it is a NOP, sometimes used after DSE or ISG, in
  cases where the 'skipping' behavior of those functions is not wanted.
* In lowercase print mode (flag 13 set), functions with hidden characters,
  e.g. COMPLEX/CPLX, were printed wrong ("cOMplEx" instead of "complex").
  Fixed.
* Added rom2raw.c to the source tree. This is a program that extracts user code
  from *.ROM format HP-41 module images; it converts XROM calls to user code
  within the same module to XEQ, and warns about all other XROMs (except the
  ones that correspond to HP-42S instructions). At some point it would be nice
  to integrate module support into Free42 itself; meanwhile here's hoping this
  will also be useful. I'll put it on my web page as a separate download,
  complete with a ready-to-run Windows executable, once I iron out the
  wrinkles.
* Added KR and Widgi42 skins (for the Motif & Windows versions).

2006-02-07: release 1.3.16

* A few obscure printing fixes (PRX now prints complex scalars left-justified
  if they do not fit on one line; the same now happens for command printing in
  NORM and TRACE modes).
* Modified most skins so all the sensitive rectangles are now as large as
  possible, making keys easier to hit with the mouse. (The sensitive rectangle
  for a key is the area on the screen where a mouse click will cause the key to
  be pressed; in several skins this area was the size of the keys themselves,
  but after this modification, the area extends several pixels beyond the keys,
  meaning you can be a bit sloppier now, which is good because it reduces
  strain on the arm muscles and tendons.)
  I did not change the Semi-Auto skins yet, because my automatic rectangle-
  stretching program currently only handles 37-key layouts. Fortunately, the
  Semi-Auto skins already have large sensitive rectangles, which cannot be
  enlarged much further anyway. (I know, lame excuse!)
* In skins/SemiReal42.gif and palmskins/SemiReal42HD.gif, moved the Rv key one
  pixel to the left. It's been annoying me forever -- can't think why I didn't
  fix this earlier. :-)

2006-02-06: release 1.3.15

* The PRX command no longer prints three asterisks when printing a complex
  number or a matrix. Also, when printing a matrix, in addition to printing
  the descriptor line (as shown in the display), it now prints the matrix
  contents as well. These changes bring the Free42 PRX command in line with
  the HP-42S.
* Windows & Motif versions: Fixed handling of PC keyboard key rollover (i.e.
  pressing a key before the previous key is released). This should fix the
  problem of keystrokes being missed when typing rapidly.
* Windows & Motif versions: When the A..F menu in the BASE application is
  active, the A through F keys are now mapped to the corresponding menu keys,
  regardless of the keyboard map -- so you can now enter a number like FCE2
  without having to use the mouse or the F1-F6 keys.
* Added MacDashboard version to the source distribution. No binary
  distribution, alas, because I don't have a MacOS X build environment.
  MacDashboard code written by D. Jeff Dionne.

2006-02-01: release 1.3.14

* Windows version: Added always-on-top feature.
* Windows version: In the previous release, when I fixed the code that saves
  the window positions when exiting using the OFF command, I broke the code
  that saves the window positions when exiting using the close box and the Quit
  command. Fixed, so now window positions should be remembered correctly
  regardless of how Free42 is exited.

2006-01-29: release 1.3.13

* Fixed behavior of Y^X for certain special cases (namely, 0^(0,0); (0,0)^0;
  (0,0)^(0,0); 0^(1,0); (0,0)^(1,0). Note that the first three of those now
  return (1,0); this is not consistent with the real HP-42S, which returns
  "Invalid Data", but it is consistent with the way Free42 already treated
  0^0).
* SIN, COS, P->R, and COMPLEX, when used in DEG and GRAD modes, now return
  exact results for multiples of 90 degrees (100 grads). Also, the TAN function
  now returns exact results for multiples of 45 degrees (50 grads).
* Added range checks to the complex versions of SIN and COS.
* In PRGM mode, the A..F command in the BASE menu now says "Restricted
  Operation".
* Windows version: When exiting the emulator using the OFF command (shift-EXIT
  or XEQ "OFF"), the positions of the main and print-out windows would not get
  updated in the state file.

2005-06-20: release 1.3.12

* Motif version: Closing the print-out window did not work in the Cygwin build.
  The problem appears to be in the Cygwin Lesstif library: the XmUNMAP setting
  for the deleteResponse resource in TopLevelShell does not work.
  I now work around this by using the XmDO_NOTHING setting instead, and calling
  XWithdrawWindow() explicitly in the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol handler.

2005-06-19: release 1.3.11

* DOT did not drop the stack; it placed the result in X but left Y intact.
  Fixed.

2005-06-14: release 1.3.10

* PalmOS version: In the file selection dialog, sorting was broken. It sorted
  the volume list, which it shouldn't, and when sorting directory listings, it
  sorted the names but not the types, and it did not force directories to the
  top of the list. Oops! So many bugs in such a trivial enhancement... Well,
  it's fixed now, and I'm taking a vacation from this project. :-)

2005-06-14: release 1.3.9

* PalmOS version: In the file selection dialog, file names are now sorted
  alphabetically.

2005-06-09: release 1.3.8

* PalmOS version: Added Copy and Paste icons to the command bar for the
  calculator form.
* PalmOS version: The Edit and Skin menus were switched in the print-out form.
  Fixed.

2005-05-12: release 1.3.7

* PalmOS version: Hardware Up and Down keys now scroll the print-out window.

2005-05-12: release 1.3.6

* Windows version: Fixed computation of scroll bar width, so Windows 2000 users
  who use "Large Fonts" (or otherwise wider-than-normal scroll bars) don't lose
  pixels at the right edge of the print-out window.
* PalmOS version: Pressing and holding the 5-way navigator's center button now
  exits to the Application Launcher (this is an automatic PalmOS behavior,
  which I had unintentionally sabotaged before by mis-handling auto-repeat
  events).

2005-05-11: release 1.3.5

* Improved import of HP-41 programs: numbers with exponent but no mantissa are
  now handled correctly (e.g. 'e4' becomes '1e4', rather than '0'); XROM
  instructions that do not correspond to HP-42S built-in functions are now
  imported as XROM instructions, rather than being skipped.
  Note that XROM instructions always return the "Nonexistent" error message, so
  HP-41 programs that rely on non-HP-42S extensions still won't actually work
  in Free42, but at least now you will be able to see more easily *why* such
  programs fail.
* PalmOS version: PalmOS 5.0 (and 5.1?) has a bug in FileControl(): the
  fileOpGetOpenDbRef command returns a bogus value; when using this value in
  subsequent Data Manager calls, a crash results. This was noticed on a Palm
  Tungsten T and on PalmOS Simulator 5.
  This bug caused Free42 to crash on exit on some devices (it would crash while
  trying to set the "backup" bit on the Free42State file). I changed my code so
  that it obtains the necessary information another way.
* Motif version: Fixed a bug that could cause a crash whenever a file selection
  dialog was created. I never noticed it causing a problem in Linux, but it
  did crash the Cygwin build, and it was incorrect code anyway. Fixed now.

2005-04-21: release 1.3.4

* PalmOS version: Yet another 'program import' bug, this time due to a
  difference of opinion between gcc and g++ about sign extension. Fixed.

2005-04-21: release 1.3.3

* PalmOS version: Program import and HP-41 synonym lookup were broken, again
  apparently because the PalmOS version of g++ does not handle const globals
  properly. I removed the 'const' qualifier from a few lookup tables and that
  seems to have solved the problem.

2005-04-21: release 1.3.2

* PalmOS version: Added key click sound, to give the user audible feedback when
  Free42 receives a key press (pen tap) on the emulated keyboard.
* Added skins with single-click activation for shifted keys (Windows/Motif and
  high-density PalmOS versions). Contributed by Jeff O.
* Added compact version of Erik Ehrling's realistic skin (Windows/Motif only).
  Contributed by Michael Vogel.

2005-04-06: release 1.3.1

* In the previous release, I broke the FCN catalog in the PalmOS version.
  Those pesky 'const' globals again! Oops...

2005-04-06: release 1.3

* Converted the project to C++ in preparation for implementing BCD support.

2005-03-23: release 1.2.10

* The code in ->HMS, HMS+, and HMS-, that was supposed to prevent results such
  as ->HMS(61/60) = 1.006 (by adding 0.4 to fix the minutes, or 0.004 to fix
  the seconds, to get 1.01 in this example) was incorrect; it would apply the
  correction in cases where the intermediate result was rounded down due to
  binary round-off; this would cause ->HMS(119/60) to return 1.594 instead of
  1.59. Fixed by making the test for when to perform the adjustment more
  accurate.

2005-03-21: release 1.2.9

* PalmOS version: Fixed a couple of problems with the hardware Up and Down
  keys: auto-repeat events are now ignored (Free42 handles that on its own),
  and SST in RUN mode now shows the instruction to be executed, and goes to
  NULL, if held down for 1/4 second and 2 seconds, respectively.

2005-03-21: release 1.2.8

* Motif version: File selection dialogs now use option menus for file type
  selection. The only remaining difference between these, and the Windows and
  PalmOS versions, is that the Motif version uses case-sensitive matching, so
  the "*.raw" filter won't match "foo.RAW". You'd think this would be a
  simple matter of using a custom file search procedure, but there turn out to
  be weird side effects (with Open Motif 2.2.2, though not with Lesstif,
  interestingly enough). That'll require some more research.
* Motif & Windows versions: Did not repaint the skins after skin switching in
  certain circumstances. I added code to force a full repaint.
* Windows version: The message and title on several message boxes were
  switched. I guess nobody ever saw those messages anyway. :-)
* Did some serious spring cleaning in my TODO list. There were a lot of goals
  there, which, to my mind, were just too much effort for too little gain.
  At this moment, BCD and Pocket PC support are my only *serious* remaining
  objectives, apart from continuing to fix bugs of course.
  Maybe I will reconsider some of the deleted objectives eventually, but that's
  unlikely to happen before the gloomy days and long nights of winter return
  (oh, how conducive they are to the coding mind-set!). I'll keep them off the
  TODO list, so as to avoid giving the impression that stuff like a larger
  display or algebraic equations are actually planned and likely to arrive
  sometime soon, and also to give myself the satisfied feeling of "not much
  left to do". :-)

2005-03-20: release 1.2.7

* Windows version: Could not write the registry value to store the Free42
  directory location (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Thomas Okken Software\Free42
  \HomeDir) unless the parent key existed already -- which, unless you have the
  Free42 Conduit for the PalmOS version installed, it won't! Oops! Fixed now.

2005-03-20: release 1.2.6

* Windows version: With the ALPHA menu active, some PC keys that generate
  printable ASCII codes (e.g., shift-equals for '+'; also backslash, period,
  comma) were not handled properly and went through the regular non-ALPHA
  mapping, meaning the corresponding characters could not be typed directly.
  Fixed.
* PalmOS version: The hardware "Up" and "Down" keys are now mapped to the
  emulated "Up" and "Down" keys.
* 'Paste' didn't enable stack lift. It does now.
* 'Paste' now accepts numbers in the same format that 'Copy' produces, which is
  the format used on the calculator's display -- so flag 28 controls whether
  '.' or ',' is the decimal. Thousands separators are ignored regardless of the
  setting of flag 29.
* 61 ENTER 60 / ->HMS now returns 1.01 instead of 1.006. I added a check to
  see if round-off after the final computation step caused the seconds or
  minutes to reach 60. I also added this same check to HMS+ and HMS-.
* Clicking in the bottom half of the display now activates "soft" (menu) keys.
  This actually means you now simply have another way of clicking the six keys
  in the top row of the keyboard, but the visual feedback is different, and
  some may find it more intuitive than clicking the keyboard keys when working
  with menus.
* Windows version: Now allows 'Alt' to be used in keyboard mappings. I'm a bit
  uneasy about my keyboard message handling code; it took some trial and error
  before I got to the point where Free42's mappings were coexisting with the
  standard Windows Ctrl/Alt behavior in the menu bar, and I don't fully
  understand *why* my code works. Maybe that's just what programming Windows is
  supposed to be like <g>. Anyway, if it turns out that this code breaks on
  more recent versions of Windows (I use 98SE myself), I'm sure I'll hear about
  it, and if so, I'll just rip it out. The code that deals only with Ctrl and
  Shift seems to have been fine, so I can always fall back on that if need be.
* Windows version: Now allows the user to choose the location of the Free42
  directory (meaning, the directory where the state, print-out, keymap, and
  skin files are stored). Also, skin files are now looked for in the Free42
  directory *and* in the directory containing the executable, so a shared
  installation of Free42 can also have a shared set of skins.

2005-03-18: release 1.2.5

* Skins now handle multiple keys with the same key code properly: the key that
  is clicked is the one that is highlighted, instead of the last matching one
  in the layout description; and when a PC keyboard key is pressed that is
  mapped to a calculator key for which multiple keys exist in the skin
  description, the first one is highlighted, instead of the last one.
* Macro keys: in the *.layout files, it is now possible to define keys with
  keycodes in the range 38..255; these keys are mapped using "Macro:"
  definitions in the same *.layout file. The macro is a sequence of zero or
  more standard key codes (1..37).
* Windows & Motif versions: Key mappings can now be defined in the skin *.layout
  file. The syntax is identical to that used in the keymap.txt/keymap file.
  When the skin maps a key that is also mapped in the default keymap file, the
  skin's mapping takes precedence.
  Note that such customized *.layout files are OS-dependent, since the way PC
  keyboard keys are specified is different between Windows and Motif: Windows
  uses numeric key codes, while Motif uses X11 KeySyms.

2005-03-18: release 1.2.4

* PalmOS version: The Delete Skin feature would crash when there were no
  external skins installed. Fixed.

2005-03-16: release 1.2.3

* DELR, with 'I' pointing to the bottom row, would leave 'I' pointing past the
  bottom of the matrix, and, when used in EDIT or EDITN mode, display a bogus
  value in X. When writing a new value to the matrix after this happens, memory
  corruption could result. Fixed now.

2005-03-15: release 1.2.2

* PalmOS version: Added a feature to let the user remove external skins (i.e.
  skins that aren't built into Free42, but that were installed as separate
  PRC files). So, now you don't need to use Filez any more to accomplish this
  task, never mind having to uninstall everything and start all over.
* PalmOS version: On devices with Graffiti 1, upper- and lower-case characters
  are now switched, so that uppercase characters are easier to enter. This was
  done because uppercase is much more common than lowercase in Free42. On
  devices with Graffiti 2, case switching is not performed, since there
  uppercase requires no extra gestures, but can be entered simply by jotting in
  the center of the input area.
* Added two new skins to the Free42PalmOSSkins.zip package, and another to the
  Free42Skins.zip package. Thanks to Jeff O. for contributing these!

2005-03-15: release 1.2.1

* Windows version: In 1.2, I broke the Skin menu so switching skins didn't work
  any more. Fixed now.

2005-03-14: release 1.2

* Implemented simple Copy and Paste: 'Copy' puts a text representation of the
  X register on the clipboard (identical to what you see in the display, except
  the exponent 'E' in numbers is changed to a plain lowercase 'e'); 'Paste'
  tries to parse the clipboard contents as a complex number (formatted as
  "a ib", "a + bi", or "(a, b)", or if that fails, as a real number; if it
  can't parse the clipboard, it just pastes it as a string.

2005-03-13: release 1.1.19

* Using the keyboard to enter the first character of a LBL name or number
  caused a crash (all versions). Fixed.
* Windows and Motif versions: The 0-9 keys on the PC keyboard now act like the
  number keys on the virtual keyboard *even* at the beginning of a LBL. This
  allows the keyboard to be used to enter numeric labels.

2005-03-13: release 1.1.18

* PalmOS version: Improved support for PalmOS < 3.5: now has a sound volume
  control in the Preferences dialog (ugly but functional); and now allows skin
  switching (using a dialog instead of a dynamic menu).
* Motif and Windows versions: Implemented keyboard mapping. When Free42 is run,
  it looks for $HOME/.free42/keymap (Motif) or "My Documents"\Free42\keymap.txt
  (Windows), and if it doesn't exist, it creates a new one, which provides
  mappings for all calculator keys and also contains comments explaining the
  keymap file format.
* PalmOS version: Now accepts Graffiti input when the ALPHA menu is active.
  Printable ASCII characters (codes in the range 32..126), and Backspace and
  Enter, can be entered this way.
* Motif and Windows versions: Now accept keyboard input when the ALPHA menu is
  active. Keystrokes that do not correspond to printable ASCII characters
  (codes in the range 32..126) are handled according to the keyboard mapping
  (see above).

2005-03-08: release 1.1.17

* PalmOS version: Relaxed system requirements to PalmOS 3.0 or later (it used
  to require 3.5 or later). Note that the oldest PalmOS version this has
  actually been tested with is 3.3 (so far). Also note that pre-3.5, there are
  a couple of restrictions: the volume control in the Preferences dialog is
  missing, because pre-3.5 does not support sliders; the Skin menu only shows
  one item named "Default", because pre-3.5 does not support dynamic menus (and
  I have been too lazy to work around that using a dialog box; since pre-3.5
  does not have color, I figure there's not that much need for changing skins
  anyway), and there may be other miscellaneous bits of flakiness (e.g. pen
  events on menus getting reported to the underlying form as well -- this can
  lead to surprising behavior). So, bottom line, you can now use Free42 on your
  trusty old Palm V etc., but I still *recommend* PalmOS 3.5 or later.

2005-03-07: release 1.1.16

* PalmOS version: Implemented pluggable skin support. Skins are PRC files that
  are generated from the same type of *.layout and *.gif files that the Windows
  and Motif versions use directly.

2005-03-02: release 1.1.15

* SOLVE: When the secant extrapolation makes no more progress (the extrapolated
  value coincides with one of the previous two 'x' values), we assume we've
  found a root -- but the code would not necessarily return the right 'x' to
  the X register. This means that when the iteration was started with one
  starting value being a root, and the other starting value being way off, the
  way-off value could be returned in X. Oops! Fixed now.
* SOLVE: when the search for a sign change reaches infinity, it would report
  the final value of X to be POS_HUGE_DOUBLE or NEG_HUGE_DOUBLE. That wasn't
  really correct, since it would return that value without actually having
  evaluated the function at that point. I changed it so that it returns the
  last 'x' that was actually used.
* Windows version: The Free42State.bin and Free42Print.bin files are now called
  state.bin and print.bin, respectively, and they're no longer stored in the
  directory containing Free42.exe, but rather in "My Documents"\Free42 (this
  directory is automagically created if necessary). Storing the state under
  My Documents means multiple users sharing one PC no longer share one Free42
  state.
* Windows version: Implemented pluggable skin support. Each skin consists of a
  pair of files, named <skinname>.layout and <skinname>.gif. Skins are loaded
  from the "My Documents"\Free42 directory; this is also the directory where
  Free42 stores its persistent state, starting with this release.
* In the "Standard" skin (Standard.gif), 10^X and E^X were swapped. Fixed now.
* Motif version: Three XtVaSetValues() calls were missing the final NULL
  parameter, which could cause segmentation faults. Miraculously, this never
  seems to have done any harm in my Linux/x86 builds, but it did cause a crash
  under MacOS X, and it's wrong anyway. Fixed now.

2005-02-27: release 1.1.14

* Removed "f42" program file format support. The f42 format wasn't portable: it
  was just a dump of Free42's in-memory representation of programs, and the way
  noninteger number literals are stored (as native 'double') was a potential
  source of trouble, because of endianness and because of format differences
  (in case anyone is running Free42 on a non-IEEE-754 platform).
  At present, the format isn't needed anyway, because the Free42 instruction
  set is identical to that of the HP-42S, so all Free42 programs can be
  unambiguously encoded using the "raw" format; by the time I start extending
  the instruction set, I'll have to design a new format (without f42's
  portability problems!) or just define extensions to "raw", using the same
  mechanisms that were used to add the HP-42S instructions to the HP-41C
  instruction set (XROM and special strings).
* Because programs are now only stored in HP-42S-compatible "raw" files, there
  is no longer any point in showing program sizes in Free42 units, so the
  "HP-42S byte counts" option has been removed from the Preferences dialog, and
  program sizes are now always shown in HP-42S units.
* Pluggable skin support (Motif version only at the moment; this will be added
  to the PalmOS and Windows versions in the next week or so).

2005-02-11: release 1.1.13

* It wasn't possible to enter FIX/SCI/ENG IND nn when nn > 11; in that case, nn
  would be changed to 11 -- which is the right thing to do for FIX/SCI/ENG nn,
  but not for the IND case. Fixed.
* In the previous release, I was a bit too zealous about deleting the code that
  handles ARGTYPE_COMMAND for FCN catalog assignments: I mistakenly removed the
  code that displays and executes this type of assignment in a program. Oops!
  It's restored now. Note: it has not been possible to *create* such program
  lines since release 1.1.5 (see the first item in the release 1.1.5 notes,
  below), but this code is needed for compatibility with programs created with
  Free42 release 1.1.4 and earlier.

2005-02-11: release 1.1.12

* SOLVE: if the search for two points with function values with opposite signs
  reaches infinity suspiciously quickly (in less than 10 steps), and only one
  initial guess was given, retry with initial guesses of 0 and 1.
  This can help in some cases where the left-over value in the variable, and
  the previous starting value, are identical (and misleading), and no new
  starting value was given before invoking SOLVE.
* When entering a LBL command, it wasn't possible to specify the label name by
  selecting it from a catalog -- the top-level catalog could be brought up, but
  pressing any of its keys would take you back to the ALPHA menu.
* It wasn't possible to enter commands with IND "string" arguments by selecting
  the argument from the FCN catalog; the IND would disappear in that case.
* Fixed a couple of extremely obscure Free42/HP-42S incompatibilities:
  1) When a program line like LBL "ENTER" is created by selecting ENTER from
  the FCN catalog, the label now contains the command name with "meta"
  characters for the letters that are suppressed in the FCN catalog (e.g., the
  second E in ENTER) -- so the string ENTER in this example is encoded as 0x45,
  0x4E, 0x54, 0xC5, 0x52. This means that, with a label as above, GTO "ENTER",
  with the word ENTER typed using the ALPHA menu, now results in "Label Not
  Found", since in that case, the string ENTER is encoded as 0x45, 0x4E, 0x54,
  0x45, 0x52, which does not match the label.
  Note that this does not just apply to LBL and GTO, but in *all* situations
  where the FCN catalog is used to create a string argument.
  2) In ASSIGN, when the command to be assigned is selected from the FCN
  catalog, it is now assigned by name, and no longer by command ID. This means
  that such assignments can now change meaning if a label or variable with a
  matching name is created (as was already the case when the command name was
  entered by any means *other* than the FCN catalog).

2005-02-10: release 1.1.11

* SOLVE: if the search for two points with function values with opposite signs
  reaches infinity suspiciously quickly (in less than 10 steps), assume that
  the larger of the initial guesses is bad, and retry with just the smaller.
  This can help in some cases where a left-over value in the variable to be
  solved for can send SOLVE in the wrong direction.

2005-02-02: release 1.1.10

* Another DET problem: the fix in 1.1.9 was itself broken; it would set 'det'
  to 1 each time the real-valued LU decomposition worker procedure was entered,
  instead of only doing that the first time; this would not cause a problem if
  the matrix in question was small enough to be decomposed in only 1 invocation
  of the worker (12x12 or less), but result in bogus determinants otherwise.
  Fixed.
* Yet another couple of DET bugs: singular matrices weren't handled properly:
  in "Singular Matrix" mode, they would return the "Singular Matrix" error,
  instead of 0, and when "Singular Matrix" mode was off, they would return a
  small value that resulted from the HP-42S-compatible zero-pivot fudging that
  takes place in that mode (it shouldn't do that fudging when computing only
  the determinant, regardless of whether "Singular Matrix" mode is on or off).
  Both of those bugs applied to both the real and complex cases; they're all
  fixed now.
* The "left arrow", "right arrow", "up arrow", and "down arrow" commands for
  matrix editing (EDIT/EDITN/INDEX) did not work correctly when editing a 1x1
  matrix. Fixed.

2005-02-02: release 1.1.9

* DET returned bogus results for real nonsingular matrices -- nasty bug that I
  introduced when I made the LU decomposition code interruptible in release
  1.0.17 (the 'det' field in the LU decomposition state was not initialized to
  1 at the start of the decomposition). The complex case did work correctly;
  the real case does so too, again, now.

2005-01-31: release 1.1.8

* It was possible to enter and leave PRGM mode while in the middle of command
  entry. Fixed.
* It wasn't possible to enter the number -2147483648 as a program line. Fixed.
* Flag 47 was set when VARMENU was active, *and* when the variable menus in the
  SOLVE and INTEG applications were active. It should *only* be set when the
  regular VARMENU is active. Fixed.
* Flags 76 and 77 (matrix edge wrap, and matrix end wrap, respectively) were
  set wrong by the I+, I-, "up-arrow", and "down-arrow" commands: when the
  top/bottom edge was crossed, flag 77 would be set (should have been 76), and
  when it jumped from the top-left corner to the bottom-right (or vice versa),
  flag 76 would be set (should have been 77). Fixed. Note: J+, J-,
  "left-arrow", and "right-arrow" did the right thing already.
* GETKEY no longer causes the display to be refreshed.
* GETKEY now turns off the 'running' annunciator while it is waiting.
* If Free42 is exited while GETKEY is waiting (or if the power was cycled
  (PalmOS only)), it returns code 70 (OFF) and stops program execution, just as
  if OFF had been pressed twice on a real 42S: once to get out of GETKEY and
  stop the program, and again to actually switch the calculator off.
* PalmOS version: If the system requests permission to perform auto-poweroff,
  and Free42 refuses while a GETKEY is pending, GETKEY returns 70, program
  execution continues (if applicable), and the power stays on. (This is how it
  works on the real HP-42S, too; presumably, the idea is to allow GETKEY-using
  programs to implement battery-friendly behavior.)

2005-01-29: release 1.1.7

* When XEQ was performed in a program, while the return stack was already full,
  the previous top-of-stack would be lost (really silly off-by-one error in the
  code that shifts the stack for this case). I noticed this while playing Erik
  Ehrling's Okie Dokie: it would start to act weird if you played 8 fields in
  a row. Oops!

2005-01-29: release 1.1.6

* In store_var(), added a check to see if the target variable is the indexed
  matrix; if it is, I and J need to be reset to 1 (top-left corner). Without
  this, the code was not HP-42S compatible, and what's worse, it could leave
  I and J pointing outside the new array, so that a subsequent STOEL would
  cause memory corruption.

2005-01-27: release 1.1.5

* When storing ASSIGN in a program, and the function to be assigned was
  selected from the FCN catalog, the function's opcode would be stored with the
  instruction, rather than its string representation. As far as Free42 itself
  is concerned, this is fine, but it is not how the HP-42S works, and what's
  worse, the "raw" mode export code and the HP-42S-compatible byte counter both
  couldn't handle it, and generated bogus code and nonsense byte counts.
  I decided to kill all birds with one stone by forcing the FCN-to-string
  conversion in store_command(); for backward compatibility, export_hp42s() and
  hp42s_size() now handle the FCN version correctly as well.
* It wasn't possible to enter DIM IND, EDITN IND, INDEX IND, INTEG IND ST, and
  SOLVE IND ST. Fixed.
* Thanks to Vini Matangrano for stress testing Free42's command entry and thus
  finding these bugs & bringing them to my attention!

2005-01-26: release 1.1.4

* PalmOS version: When printing to GIF, and the GIF file name field in the
  preferences dialog was blank, the resulting files would be named .0000.gif
  etc., which is OK, but the path that was stored in the file's data records
  would be //.0000.gif -- and that extra slash would make the file impossible
  to delete. This is now fixed, but if you have a Free42 filesystem with such
  undeletable files, you will have to download the entire filesystem to a PC,
  then erase it, and then upload it back to the Palm. This will get rid of all
  bad pathnames. Simply resetting the Palm while Free42 is running will *not*
  fix this problem; resetting the Palm with Free42 active causes the directory
  to be rebuilt using information from the data record headers, but in this
  case, the problem isn't the directory at all, it's the data record headers,
  and fixing *them* requires the download-erase-upload method.
* PalmOS version: No longer allows open files to be deleted from the Free42
  filesystem.
* Motif version: The .free42rc and .free42print files are now called
  .free42/state and .free42/print, respectively; creating the .free42 directory
  was necessary anyway in preparation for pluggable-skin support (gotta put
  those skins somewhere!), and so I moved the state and print-out files there,
  too, in order to clean up the home directory a little.
* CLP would not update the current_prgm index. This meant that if the current
  program was after the deleted program, the pc could end up pointing at an
  invalid location, and if the current program was the last program, the
  current_prgm index would end up pointing beyond the end of the prgms array;
  this could lead to memory corruption or a crash. Now fixed.

2005-01-21: release 1.1.3

* Multi-row VARMENUs could cause a crash when switching rows. Fixed.
* When a command is completed by making a selection from the PGM catalog, the
  selected label or END is now echoed on the screen, even if the key isn't held
  down for 1/4 a second. This is necessary for commands that take a long time
  to execute: when printing a program, you should not be seeing PRP "_ while
  the program is being printed; the display should show the full PRP "name",
  which it now does.
* PalmOS version: MEM now reports the number of free bytes in the dynamic
  (application) heap, rather than the total number of free bytes in the system.
  This is better because the dynamic heap is where Free42 actually stores
  programs and variables, and it can get full even though the system as a whole
  still has lots of free space.

2005-01-19: release 1.1.2

* PRP & LIST: in strings and in string arguments, translate character code 10
  (LF) to 138, so that it shows up properly in text-mode program listings,
  rather than becoming an actual line break. In "raw text" listings, this means
  it becomes Ctrl-Meta-J, but that's the best I can do, I guess. In "normal"
  mode listings, it is now rendered as "\LF". Graphics-mode listings (GIF and
  on-screen) already did the right thing.
* It was possible to do SST and BST while in the middle of command entry; this
  made it possible to go to line 00 and have an instruction inserted in the
  program at pc = -1, which caused memory corruption because it would write a
  byte before the start of the program block. (Line 01 corresponds with pc = 0,
  in other words, the pc is a byte offset from the beginnig of the program;
  pc = -1 is a special value used to indicate line 00, which isn't a physical
  program line at all.) I plugged the SST/BST hole and for good measure, I also
  added a check to store_command() to make sure that it never inserts anything
  at pc = -1.
* PalmOS version: When a file was deleted from the Free42 filesystem, and the
  directory entry immediately preceding it was a directory, that directory
  would be resized just as if the deleted file had been in it, resulting in a
  bogus directory length and a corrupted directory structure (which can be
  repaired by resetting the Palm while Free42 is running; when this happens,
  Free42 will rebuild the directory the next time it starts up). Fixed now.
* Windows & Motif versions: GIF file names looked like foobar0000.gif, should be
  foobar.0000.gif, like in the PalmOS version. Fixed.
* Motif version: When the print window scrolls because of a print command, while
  it is partially obscured, the region that is scrolled out from under the
  obscuring window did not get painted. I added a GraphicsExpose event handler
  that schedules a full repaint whenever that happens. Not pretty, but unless I
  can find a way to handle those events synchronously (as they are caused by
  the scroll operation), it's the best I can do.

2005-01-17: release 1.1.1

* Free42 Conduit: fixed a bug that would cause it to write past the end of a
  memory block, causing it to crash (and take down HotSync Manager with it).
* PalmOS version: Fixed a bug in the file selection dialog, that would cause
  the file list to be initially empty under certain circumstances.
* The auto-repeat feature on the 'up' and 'down' keys would leave the
  'repeating' mode flag set, even after the key was released. This would cause
  the next key pressed to act like 'up' or 'down', even if it was a different
  key -- provided it was held down long enough for the auto-repeat timeout to
  expire.
* SOLVE: in the situation where f(x1) and f(x2) have the same sign but
  different values, x3 is computed by the secant method; if f(x3) is worse than
  f(x1) and f(x2), the interval is bisected -- but this code had a bug: if
  f((x1+x2)/2) was *also* worse than f(x1) and f(x2), it would repeat the
  bisection step without changing x1 and x2 first, and so the algorithm could
  get stuck. I fixed this by *always* assigning x3 to the worse of x1 and x2
  after bisection, thus making sure that there is always change (if not
  necessarily progress, but that's another story).

2005-01-15: release 1.1

* Implemented program import and export, both in original HP-42S format (which
  is also the format used by Emu42), and in Free42's own internal format.
* PalmOS version: Implemented a simple filesystem (using a PalmOS database
  underneath) which makes it possible to support program import and export, and
  printing to text and GIF files, on PalmOS devices that lack VFS support.
  A HotSync Conduit is provided to mirror this filesystem on a PC (Windows
  only, for now; maybe I'll do a Java version later).
* Added an option to display the byte count on line 00 assuming HP-42S format.
  Note: program lines containing numbers are stored in binary in Free42; this
  means that 1e3 and 1000 end up being the same -- unlike on the HP-42S, where
  those lines are different, and have different numbers of bytes.
  When computing the HP-42S byte count, Free42 always assumes the most compact
  form of a number -- but this means that if you import a program containing
  numbers that are *not* maximally compact, the byte count given by Free42
  will be lower than that on the HP-42S.
* Changed many of the special character substitutions that are made when
  sending printer output to text files or PalmOS memos, hopefully making them
  more readable; also added an option to suppress those substitutions
  altogether ("Raw text" in the Preferences dialog).
* PalmOS version: Can now activate the menu bar by tapping in the top part of
  the screen.
* The BCD conversion table (37 kilobytes) is no longer stored in the state
  file. The Windows and Motif versions now rebuild it each time they start up
  (PCs are fast enough to do this) and the PalmOS version now stores it in a
  database. Windows and Motif users will probably not notice any difference
  (apart from a smaller state file); PalmOS users may notice that they now have
  more application heap space to play with, startup and shutdown are faster,
  and HotSyncing the state file is faster.
* PalmOS version: Added a sound volume control to the Preferences dialog.
* PalmOS version: Fixed a bug that would cause the state file to become
  corrupted when writing large matrices (real matrices with >= 4096 elements,
  complex matrices with >= 2048 elements).
* Windows version: When the print-out window is partially obscured, no longer
  scrolls the obscuring window into the print-out.

2004-12-20: release 1.0.17

* NORM and TRACE print modes: numbers entered by the user are now printed as
  entered, not formatted according to the active display mode -- except for one
  detail: if the display mode is FIX n, and the entered number does not contain
  an exponent, and the fractional part has fewer than n digits, it is padded
  with zeroes to n digits, so that decimal points will line up. (I got this
  from the HP-97 manual; here's hoping that the HP-42S/HP-82240A are similar.)
* All O(n^3) matrix functions (INVRT, DET, SIMQ (MATX), matrix-matrix division,
  and matrix-matrix multiplication) are now interruptible (by EXIT).
* LIST, PRP, PRUSR, and PRV are now interruptible (by EXIT and R/S).
* Changed the Makefile for the Motif version slightly, so that the mask bitmap
  that it generates is called Mask1.pbm (and Mask1.xbm); this way the name does
  not clash with the unscaled mask.pbm on case-insensitive filesystems.
* Windows version: The print-out window scrolling code now actually scrolls the
  window, instead of invalidating and repainting everything all the time. This
  makes programs that print a lot of output run faster.
  (If LIST, PRP, PRUSR, and PRV seem *slower* than in the previous release,
  that's because they're interruptible now: after each line, Free42 returns to
  the message loop, and during an interruptible print operation, each time
  there will be a WM_PAINT message to paint the most recent line -- so each
  line is actually painted on the screen *as it is generated*; the previous
  release didn't render anything on the screen until the whole printout was
  finished, and that was obviously faster, but not very pretty.)

2004-12-17: release 1.0.16

* NORM and TRACE print modes implemented, including the different formats used
  by PRP and LIST (right-justified and compact, respectively).
  I'm sure many differences remain between Free42 printer emulation and the
  real HP-42S + HP-82240A, but hopefully this NORM and TRACE implementation is
  close enough to be useful.
  (If you spot a discrepancy between Free42 and the original, please feel free
  to report it to the author so he can fix it. It will be appreciated!)
* Motif version: The print-out window scroll bar now has its increment (i.e.,
  the amount by which it scrolls when the arrows are clicked) set to 18 pixels.
  This corresponds to one text-mode output line. (The Windows version already
  behaved like this; the PalmOS version will, too, as soon as I figure out how
  to control this aspect of scroll bar behavior on that platform.)
* PRP now prints a highlight ("goose" character) in front of LBLs.
* PRP now allows the argument to be an END from the PGM catalog when in program
  mode (it already did the right thing when in normal mode).
* Flag 21 now controls PRA, PRLCD, PRX, PRSIGMA, PRSTK, PRUSR, and PRV during
  program execution. It is still ignored when these commands are executed
  interactively, and it still affects VIEW, AVIEW, ADV, and PROMPT regardless
  of whether a program is running or not (note that PROMPT prints only in NORM
  and TRACE modes).
* GTO . now allows the argument to be an END from the PGM catalog.
* Power cycles (exit/restart, and also power off/on on PalmOS) now cause
  program execution to stop if flag 11 is clear.
* CROSS with two matrix arguments did not drop the stack; it placed the result
  in X but left Y intact. Fixed.
* SST and BST now work properly even if invoked in unusual ways (XEQ, ASSIGN,
  the FCN catalog).

2004-12-14: release 1.0.15

* FIX and ALL mode now round to at most 12 digits before deciding how to
  display. This fixes two bugs: (1) in ALL mode, 0.00009999999999999999 is now
  displayed as 0.0001 instead of 1.e-4, because it now understands that the
  former does not hide any information; (2) in FIX 01 mode, 123456123456.9 is
  now displayed as 123456123457 instead of 123456123456.
* PRA now prints an empty line if the alpha register is empty; the previous
  release printed nothing in this case.
* PRSIGMA could print numbers instead of strings and vice versa (it checked the
  wrong location of the REGS matrix' is_string array). Fixed.
* Windows version: Takes display resolution ("Small/Large Fonts" desktop
  setting) into account when calculating scroll bar width, instead of assuming
  96 dpi.
* Motif version: Now remembers window positions between sessions.

2004-12-13: release 1.0.14

* Windows version: When using saved window geometry information, don't trust
  the saved width and height for the main window, and don't trust the saved
  width of the print-out window: the decor dimensions and menu bar height may
  have changed, and since we don't allow the user to resize the window in those
  directions, the result is a bit embarrassing. Also, instead of assuming that
  scroll bars are 16 pixels wide, get the value from the desktop settings in
  the registry.
* PalmOS version: Limit size of generated memos to 4096 bytes; the previous
  release had a 32767 byte limit, which turns out to cause problems with old
  versions of Memo Pad and with PACE, and to make things worse, the check for
  that limit wasn't even implemented properly (I used a 16-bit signed int.
  Oops.).
* IP hack: in addition to IP, FP, and AIP, this now applies to all functions
  that treat arguments as integers by truncating them: AROT, DIM, NEWMAT, POSA,
  R<>R, STOIJ, XTOA; BASE functions (AND, BASE+, BASE-, BASE*, BASE/, BASE+/-,
  BIT?, NOT, OR, ROTXY, XOR); and indirect addressing when the target is a
  numbered register.
  AGRAPH and PIXEL are not affected: they don't truncate their arguments, but
  round them to the nearest integer.
* Indirect address resolution: IND nn, where Rnn contains a string, did not
  work. Oops! Fixed now.

2004-12-10: release 1.0.13

* Printer emulation -- on-screen, and also prints to plain text and GIF files,
  and on PalmOS, also prints to memos. Still needs to be verified against some
  more actual HP-82240 output; also, NORM and TRACE modes not implemented yet.
* The user can now control whether or not singular matrices during matrix
  division/inversion, and range errors during matrix multiplication/division/
  inversion, generate error messages or not.
* Added "IP hack" option; this causes IP, FP, and AIP to use the value in X
  rounded to 8 decimal digits. This enables some programs that rely on BCD
  behavior to work correctly on Free42. (For example, code that stores two
  2-digit numbers in one number as AA.BB: to extract AA, it does IP, and to
  extract BB it does FP 100 x IP. In binary math, this is not reliable, since
  the representation of the BB part of AA.BB is not exact; by rounding off a
  few digits internally before doing IP/FP/AIP, the binary round-off error can
  be compensated for in many cases.)
* PalmOS version: Set "backup" flag on Free42State file, so that it is backed
  up during HotSync operations.
* PalmOS version: Fixed annoying bug that caused a beep after executing any
  menu command (the pull-down menus, not the emulated HP-42S menus!).
* Windows version: Now remembers window positions between sessions.
* Fixed menu behavior of MVAR, SOLVE, and INTEG in the case where no real
  variables exist.
* Fixed PRA in the case where it should print multiple lines (because of LF
  characters or because it doesn't fit on a line). Also affects AVIEW.
* DOT didn't accept the case where X and Y are complex scalars. Fixed.

2004-11-23: release 1.0.12

* Windows version: Added better definitions of asinh(), acosh(), atanh(),
  log1p(), and expm1(), all taken from the GNU C library, version 2.2.5.

2004-11-20: release 1.0.11

* Printer support skeleton. Doesn't actually print yet, except for the Motif
  version which can send plain text to standard output -- but now all printer-
  related functions at least behave like they would on a real HP-42S with no
  printer. This means: no more "Not Yet Implemented" error messages; PRP, LIST,
  and PRV accept the appropriate argument types, and VIEW/AVIEW stop program
  execution if flag 21 is set while flag 55 is clear.

2004-11-18: release 1.0.10

* Error handling while SOLVE and/or INTEG are active: INTEG no longer affects
  error handling (previously INTEG was treated like SOLVE, but that was wrong);
  SOLVE now traps Stat Math Error (in addition to Out of Range, Divide by 0,
  and Invalid Data, which were already being trapped), and the same set of
  errors is now trapped while RUNning as while SSTing (previously *all* errors
  were trapped while RUNning, but that was wrong).

2004-11-18: release 1.0.9

* When performing a hard reset, initialize the random number generator using
  shell_random_seed() instead of setting it to 0.
* While in command entry mode, entering a numeric argument, and the argument
  length is still 0 (e.g. just press STO or XEQ), shift-ENTER should activate
  alpha argument entry (like ENTER without shift) and not beep. Fixed.
* When used in INDEX mode, INSR would store X at IJ before inserting the new
  row, and replace X with the new contents of IJ after having inserted the new
  row (always 0). In other words, it behaved like you would expect in EDIT or
  EDITN mode. DELR had a similar bug although it was less noticeable (it would
  leave the wrong value in X but at least it did not store an incorrect value
  in the matrix). Both fixed.
* Fixed a couple of bugs that would cause INSR and DELR to update a matrix
  incorrectly if its data was shared.

2004-11-13: release 1.0.8

* CLALL would crash if invoked using XEQ or ASSIGN while spelling out the name
  (selecting it from the FCN catalog did work).
* Variable catalogs would show the up/down (multi-row menu) annunciator, even
  if they contained just one row of items.

2004-11-10: release 1.0.7

* Changed the LU decomposition code so that it will keep going when it finds
  a zero pivot, or even a whole zero column. Also added range checking to the
  back-substitution code; it replaces infinities and NaNs with
  (POS|NEG)_HUGE_DOUBLE. (NaNs should never be caused by divisions by 0, since
  I think I'm checking for that wherever it could occur, but they can also
  result from adding two infinities of opposite sign.) There is no check for
  flag 24, because the 42S ignores it in this situation, too; I also removed
  the flag-24 checks from matrix-matrix multiplication for compatibility.
* AVIEW, when displaying one line, now clears flag 51, instead of leaving it
  unchanged.
* A couple of "goose" fixes: clear row 0 before painting the goose after a PSE,
  and restart the goose at its last position when re-enabling it after a PSE or
  CLD.
* After selecting a program in the INTEG application and entering the variable
  menu, pressing a menu key immediately no longer performs a STO operation, but
  instead selects the corresponding variable as the integration variable (and
  moves on to the integration parameter menu (LLIM/ULIM/ACC/INTEG)).
  Previously, you needed two keystrokes to achieve the same effect, which was
  consistent with the other variable menus (VARMENU and SOLVER), but not with
  the real HP-42S.

2004-11-09: release 1.0.6

* Matrix-matrix division computed Y * inv(X); the HP-42S does inv(X) * Y.
  Most embarrassing Free42 bug to date! And it also means that I never
  needed the _trn_ versions of the LU decomposition and back-substitution
  functions to begin with -- so they're gone again now.
* With the INTEG Parameter menu (LLIM/ULIM/ACC/INTEG) active, STO and RCL,
  followed by one of the right 3 menu keys, caused a beep (good), but also
  caused the commands to be completed, with a bogus argument (bad).

2004-11-08: release 1.0.5

* Yet another AVIEW bug: the new line breaking logic introduced in release
  1.0.1 still does not handle LF in position 23 properly. If an LF occurs when
  the current line is full (i.e., at position 23, but that can change when I
  start supporting bigger display sizes), the result should be just one line
  break, not two.
* [MIN] and [MAX] should search column J from row I on down. My original
  implementation searched the entire column. Fixed.

2004-11-08: release 1.0.4

* SOLVE performance improvement: for the case when f(x1) and f(x2) have
  opposite signs, compute the next guess using Ridders' method instead of the
  secant method. (The secant method is still used if f(x1) and f(x2) have the
  same sign.) For well-behaved functions, this improves performance to about as
  good as the HP-42S.
* SOLVE now displays the two most recent guesses, and the signs of their
  results (or a question mark if an error was trapped while evaluating the
  function). This display is updated at most 4 times per second -- display
  operations are MUCH more expensive in the emulator than in the original, so
  you have to be careful not to throw away most of your CPU cycles on animating
  a progress indicator (especially if said progress indicator is likely to turn
  into an unreadable blur on faster machines). (This is similar to the "goose"
  situation.)
* SOLVE bug fixes: now returns not just the root in X, but also: the previous
  guess in Y, f(x) in Z, and the result code (0=root, 1=sign reversal,
  2=extremum, 3=bad guesses, 4=constant) in T. Finally, "Bad Guess(es)" is not
  an error, just a message.
* INTEG performance improvement: switched from using Simpson's Rule to the
  Romberg method. Still not quite as good as the HP-42S, but getting pretty
  close. It converges much faster than Simpson's Rule and seems quite stable.
* INTEG bug fix: now returns not just the integral in X, but also the error
  estimate in Y.
* Thank You to Hugh Steers for the Romberg implementation, and for reminding
  of the Numerical Recipes book, where I got the Ridders code.

2004-11-06: release 1.0.3

* CLALL caused memory corruption because clear_all_prgms() didn't clean up the
  'prgms' and 'labels' arrays properly. How on Earth did this manage to not
  crash when I tested it three weeks ago?!?
* When the calculator is switched off in the middle of command entry, with
  flag 11 set, command entry should be cancelled on the next power-up.
* While entering a LBL command, if the argument length is still 0, and one of
  the alpha submenus is active, interpret the number keys as alphanumeric
  rather than numeric. This allows labels like LBL "123" to be created easily.

2004-11-06: release 1.0.2

* In number entry mode, the MODES menu does not come up (the code does not
  recognize the difference between +/- and SHIFT +/- in this case). Fixed.

2004-11-06: release 1.0.1

* Reduce arguments to SIN, COS, TAN, ->REC, and COMPLEX (in POLAR mode)
  by applying fmod(x, 360) (in DEG mode) or fmod(x, 400) (in GRAD mode).
  In RAD mode, the behavior is unchanged. See angle_to_rad().
* Fixed a bug in keydown_command_entry() that made it impossible to create
  alpha LBLs where the first character was a shifted alpha menu key (e.g.
  LBL a, LBL "foo").
* Fixed bugs in keydown_normal_mode() that caused program instructions
  generated by several menus to be inserted before the current line, instead of
  after. The affected menus were CATALOG (except FCN), VARMENU (including
  variable menus displayed by the SOLVE and INTEG applications), INTEG
  parameter (LLIM/ULIM/ACC/INTEG), and CUSTOM (LCLBL mode only).
* Fixed the behavior of the XEQ (and GTO) key when the CUSTOM menu is active in
  LCLBL mode while in program entry mode. It now starts the command by calling
  do_interactive() instead of start_incomplete_command(), and the former takes
  care of the additional bookkeeping necessary in program mode, which fixes
  problems that would occur on line 00, or when cancelling the command
  (returning to the wrong line).
* Flags 47 (variable menu), 53 (input), 65 (matrix editor), and 75
  (programmable menu) did not work, because they were missing from the
  virtual_flags list in core_commands2.c. Fixed.
* A linefeed character at position 23 in the alpha register would be displayed
  as 'LF' by AVIEW. The check for LF should not be skipped immediately after a
  line wrap. Fixed, and also made the code a bit more general (not so tied to
  exactly two display lines).
* The BINM, OCTM, DECM, and HEXM commands, when executed from a program, should
  activate the BASE application, and they didn't. Fixed, and also fixed a menu
  highlighting bug which I noticed while stepping through the test case for the
  BASE bug (highlights would disappear while SST was held down).
* When entering number entry mode while in normal mode AND a menu is active,
  redraw the display to force the menu to be repainted; it could be invisible
  due to a recent two-line AVIEW.
* Added [MIN], [MAX], and [FIND] functions. See README for more information
  about these.
* PalmOS version: Reduced the beep volume from full volume to half. It really
  was a bit loud on some devices. (Of course now other people will complain
  that it's too quiet! There should be a sound volume control, but that will
  have to wait until release 1.1.)

2004-11-04: release 1.0
