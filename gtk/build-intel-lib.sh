# When building for architectures other than x86 or x86_64, I remove the
# section titled "Determine host architecture" in
# IntelRDFPMathLib20U1/LIBRARY/makefile.iml_head, and replace it with a simple
# "_HOST_ARCH := x86" or "_HOST_ARCH := x86_64", depending on whether I'm
# building for a 32-bit or 64-bit platform, respectively. The actual CPU you
# specify seems to matter less than its word size. Thus, setting _HOST_ARCH
# to x86 works when targeting armv7 and ppc, both 32-bit platforms, and setting
# it to x86_64 works when targeting arm64, a 64-bit platform.
# Of course, proceed with caution. Your mileage may vary.
