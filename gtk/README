About Free42

Free42 is a complete re-implementation of the HP-42S scientific programmable
RPN calculator, which was made from 1988 until 1995 by Hewlett-Packard.
Free42 is a complete rewrite and contains no HP code whatsoever.
At this time, the author supports versions that run on Pocket PC, Microsoft
Windows, PalmOS, Unix, and Mac OS X (application and Dashboard widget).


Installing Free42:

Copy free42dec (or free42bin, or both) to wherever you want it, e.g. $HOME/bin
or /usr/local/bin, and make sure that that directory is in your PATH
environment variable.
When Free42 runs, it will create a directory named .free42 in your home
directory; in this directory, it will create three files, 'state', 'print', and
'keymap' (the calculator's internal state, the contents of the print-out
window, and the PC keyboard map); also, if you want to use a non-standard skin
with Free42, the .free42 directory is where you have to store the skin's layout
and bitmap files.


Uninstalling Free42:

Remove free42dec, free42bin, and the $HOME/.free42 directory and its contents.


NOTE: The binary in this package was built on a PC running Fedora Core
release 6, and it is dynamically linked against glibc version 2.5, libstdc++
version 4.1.2, and GTK+ version 2.10.13. If your system has different
versions of these libraries, the binary in this package may not work. In this
case, please download the Free42 source package and compile Free42 using your
installation's own compiler and libraries.


Documentation

The ultimate documentation for Free42 is the manual for the HP-42S. You can
obtain this manual in PDF format by purchasing the CD or DVD set from The
Museum of HP Calculators (http://hpmuseum.org/). Alternatively, there is an
independently written HP-42S/Free42 manual, by Jose Lauro Strapasson, which
you can download free at http://joselauro.com/42s.pdf.


Keyboard Mapping

You don't have to use the mouse to press the keys of the emulated calculator
keyboard; all keys can be operated using the PC's keyboard as well. The
standard keyboard mapping is as follows:

Sigma+:   F1, or 'a' as in "Accumulate"
Sigma-:   Shift F1, or 'A' (Shift a)
1/X:      F2, or 'v' as in "inVerse"
Y^X:      Shift F2, or 'V' (Shift v)
SQRT:     F3, or 'q' as in "sQuare root"
X^2:      Shift F3, or 'Q' (Shift q)
LOG:      F4, or 'o' as in "lOg, not ln"
10^X:     Shift F4, or 'O' (Shift o)
LN:       F5, or 'l' as in "Ln, not log"
E^X:      Shift F5, or 'L" (Shift l)
XEQ:      F6, or 'x' as in "Xeq"
GTO:      Shift F6, or 'X' (Shift x), or 'g' as in "Gto"

STO:      'm' as in "Memory"
COMPLEX:  'M' (Shift m)
RCL:      'r' as in "Rcl"
%:        'R' (Shift r)
Rdown:    'd' as in "Down"
pi:       'D' (Shift d), or 'p' as in "Pi"
SIN:      's' as in "Sin"
ASIN:     'S' (Shift s)
COS:      'c' as in "Cos"
ACOS:     'C' (Shift c)
TAN:      't' as in "Tan"
ATAN:     'T' (Shift t)

ENTER:    Enter or Return
ALPHA:    Shift Enter or Shift Return
X<>Y:     'w' as in "sWap"
LASTX:    'W' (Shift w)
+/-:      'n' as in "Negative"
MODES:    'N' (Shift n)
E:        'e' as in "Exponent" (duh...)
DISP:     'E' (Shift e)
<-:       Backspace
CLEAR:    Shift Backspace

<Up>:     CursorUp
BST:      Shift CursorUp
7:        '7'
SOLVER:   '&' (Shift 7)
8:        '8'
Integral: Alt 8 (can't use Shift 8 because that's 'x' (multiply))
9:        '9'
MATRIX:   '(' (Shift 9)
divide:   '/'
STAT:     '?' (Shift /)

<Down>:   CursorDown
SST:      Shift CursorDown
4:        '4'
BASE:     '$' (Shift 4)
5:        '5'
CONVERT:  '%' (Shift 5)
6:        '6'
FLAGS:    '^' (Shift 6)
multiply: '*'
PROB:     Ctrl 8 (can't use Shift * because '*' is shifted itself (Shift 8))

Shift:    Shift
1:        '1'
ASSIGN:   '!' (Shift 1)
2:        '2'
CUSTOM:   '@' (Shift 2)
3:        '3'
PGM.FCN:  '#' (Shift 3)
subtract: '-'
PRINT:    '_' (Shift -)

EXIT:     Escape
OFF:      Shift Escape
0:        '0'
TOP.FCN:  ')' (Shift 0)
.:        . or ,
SHOW:     '<' or '>' (Shift . or Shift ,)
R/S:      '\' (ummm... because it's close to Enter (or Return))
PRGM:     '|' (Shift \)
add:      '+'
CATALOG:  '=' (Can't use Shift + because + is shifted itself (shift =))

In A..F mode (meaning the "A..F" submenu of the BASE menu), the PC keyboard
keys A through F are mapped to the top row of the calculator's keyboard (Sigma+
through XEQ); these mappings override any other mappings that may be defined
for A through F.

In ALPHA mode, all PC keyboard keys that normally generate printable ASCII
characters, enter those characters into the ALPHA register (or to the command
argument, if a command with an alphanumeric argument is being entered). These
mappings override any other mappings that may be defined for those keys.


What's the deal with the "Decimal" and "Binary" (free42dec/free42bin)?

Starting with release 1.4, Free42 comes in decimal and binary versions. The two
look and behave identically; the only difference is the way they represent
numbers internally.
Free42 Decimal (free42dec) uses the Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library;
it uses IEEE-754-2008 quadruple precision decimal floating point, which
consumes 16 bytes per number, and gives 34 decimal digits of precision, with
exponents ranging from -6143 to +6144.
Free42 Binary (free42bin) uses the PC's FPU; it represents numbers as IEEE-754
compatible double precision binary floating point, which consumes 8 bytes per
number, and gives an effective precision of nearly 16 decimal digits, with
exponents ranging from -308 to +308.
The binary version has the advantage of being much faster than the decimal
version; also, it uses less memory. However, numbers such as 0.1 (one-tenth)
cannot be represented exactly in binary, since they are repeating fractions
then. This inexactness can cause some HP-42S programs to fail.
If you understand the issues surrounding binary floating point, and you do not
rely on legacy software that may depend on the exactness of decimal fractions,
you may use Free42 Binary and enjoy its speed advantage. If, on the other hand,
you need full HP-42S compatibility, you should use Free42 Decimal.
If you don't fully understand the above, it is best to play safe and use
Free42 Decimal (free42dec).
